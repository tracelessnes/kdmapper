 [SECTION] Header mess
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Includes
 FLT_MIN, FLT_MAX
 va_list, va_start, va_end
 ptrdiff_t, NULL
 memset, memmove, memcpy, strlen, strchr, strcpy, strcmp
 Version
 (Integer encoded as XYYZZ for use in #if preprocessor conditionals. Work in progress versions typically starts at XYY99 then bounce up to XYY00, XYY01 etc. when release tagging happens)
 Define attributes of all API symbols declarations (e.g. for DLL under Windows)
 IMGUI_API is used for core imgui functions, IMGUI_IMPL_API is used for the default backends files (imgui_impl_xxx.h)
 Using dear imgui via a shared library is not recommended, because we don't guarantee backward nor forward ABI compatibility (also function call overhead, as dear imgui is a call-heavy API)
 Helper Macros
 You can override the default assert handler by editing imconfig.h
 Size of a static C-style array. Don't use on pointers!
 Used to silence "unused variable warnings". Often useful as asserts may be stripped out from final builds.
 Offset of _MEMBER within _TYPE. Standardized as offsetof() in C++11
 Offset of _MEMBER within _TYPE. Old style macro.
 Helper Macros - IM_FMTARGS, IM_FMTLIST: Apply printf-style warnings to our formatting functions.
 Disable some of MSVC most aggressive Debug runtime checks in function header/footer (used in some simple/low-level functions)
 Warnings
 [Static Analyzer] Variable 'XXX' is uninitialized. Always initialize a member variable (type.6).
 warning: unknown option after '#pragma GCC diagnostic' kind
 [__GNUC__ >= 8] warning: 'memset/memcpy' clearing/writing an object of type 'xxxx' with no trivial copy-assignment; use assignment or value-initialization instead
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [SECTION] Forward declarations and basic types
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Forward declarations
 Temporary storage to output draw commands out of order, used by ImDrawListSplitter and ImDrawList::ChannelsSplit()
 A single draw command within a parent ImDrawList (generally maps to 1 GPU draw call, unless it is a callback)
 All draw command lists required to render the frame + pos/size coordinates to use for the projection matrix.
 A single draw command list (generally one per window, conceptually you may see this as a dynamic "mesh" builder)
 Data shared among multiple draw lists (typically owned by parent ImGui context, but you may create one yourself)
 Helper to split a draw list into different layers which can be drawn into out of order, then flattened back.
 A single vertex (pos + uv + col = 20 bytes by default. Override layout with IMGUI_OVERRIDE_DRAWVERT_STRUCT_LAYOUT)
 Runtime data for a single font within a parent ImFontAtlas
 Runtime data for multiple fonts, bake multiple fonts into a single texture, TTF/OTF font loader
 Opaque interface to a font builder (stb_truetype or FreeType).
 Configuration data when adding a font or merging fonts
 A single font glyph (code point + coordinates within in ImFontAtlas + offset)
 Helper to build glyph ranges from text/string data
 Helper functions to create a color that can be converted to either u32 or float4 (*OBSOLETE* please avoid using)

 Helper to parse and apply text filters (e.g. "aaaaa[,bbbbb][,ccccc]")
 A Platform Window (always only one in 'master' branch), in the future may represent Platform Monitor
 Enums/Flags (declared as int for compatibility with old C++, to allow using as flags without overhead, and to not pollute the top of this file)
 - Tip: Use your programming IDE navigation facilities on the names in the _central column_ below to find the actual flags/enum lists!
   In Visual Studio IDE: CTRL+comma ("Edit.NavigateTo") can follow symbols in comments, whereas CTRL+F12 ("Edit.GoToImplementation") cannot.

 ImTexture: user data for renderer backend to identify a texture [Compile-time configurable type]
 - To use something else than an opaque void* pointer: override with e.g. '#define ImTextureID MyTextureType*' in your imconfig.h file.
 - This can be whatever to you want it to be! read the FAQ about ImTextureID for details.
 Default: store a pointer or an integer fitting in a pointer (most renderer backends are ok with that)
 ImDrawIdx: vertex index. [Compile-time configurable type]
 - To use 16-bit indices + allow large meshes: backend need to set 'io.BackendFlags |= ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset' and handle ImDrawCmd::VtxOffset (recommended).
 - To use 32-bit indices: override with '#define ImDrawIdx unsigned int' in your imconfig.h file.
 Default: 16-bit (for maximum compatibility with renderer backends)

 A unique ID used by widgets (typically the result of hashing a stack of string)
 8-bit signed integer

 64-bit unsigned integer (post C++11)
 Character types
 (we generally use UTF-8 encoded string in the API. This is storage specifically for a decoded character used for keyboard input and display)
 A single decoded U16 character/code point. We encode them as multi bytes UTF-8 when used in strings.
 A single decoded U32 character/code point. We encode them as multi bytes UTF-8 when used in strings.
 ImWchar [configurable type: override in imconfig.h with '#define IMGUI_USE_WCHAR32' to support Unicode planes 1-16]
 Callback and functions types
 Callback function for ImGui::InputText()
 Callback function for ImGui::SetNextWindowSizeConstraints()
 Function signature for ImGui::SetAllocatorFunctions()
 Function signature for ImGui::SetAllocatorFunctions()
 ImVec2: 2D vector used to store positions, sizes etc. [Compile-time configurable type]
 This is a frequently used type in the API. Consider using IM_VEC2_CLASS_EXTRA to create implicit cast from/to our preferred type.
 We very rarely use this [] operator, the assert overhead is fine.
 We very rarely use this [] operator, the assert overhead is fine.
 Define additional constructors and implicit cast operators in imconfig.h to convert back and forth between your math types and ImVec2.
 ImVec4: 4D vector used to store clipping rectangles, colors etc. [Compile-time configurable type]
 Define additional constructors and implicit cast operators in imconfig.h to convert back and forth between your math types and ImVec4.

 [SECTION] Dear ImGui end-user API functions
 (Note that ImGui:: being a namespace, you can add extra ImGui:: functions in your own separate file. Please don't modify imgui source files!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Context creation and access
 - Each context create its own ImFontAtlas by default. You may instance one yourself and pass it to CreateContext() to share a font atlas between contexts.
 - DLL users: heaps and globals are not shared across DLL boundaries! You will need to call SetCurrentContext() + SetAllocatorFunctions()
   for each static/DLL boundary you are calling from. Read "Context and Memory Allocators" section of imgui.cpp for details.
 NULL = destroy current context
 Main
 access the IO structure (mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs, time, various configuration options/flags)
 access the Style structure (colors, sizes). Always use PushStyleCol(), PushStyleVar() to modify style mid-frame!
 start a new Dear ImGui frame, you can submit any command from this point until Render()/EndFrame().
 ends the Dear ImGui frame. automatically called by Render(). If you don't need to render data (skipping rendering) you may call EndFrame() without Render()... but you'll have wasted CPU already! If you don't need to render, better to not create any windows and not call NewFrame() at all!
 ends the Dear ImGui frame, finalize the draw data. You can then get call GetDrawData().
 valid after Render() and until the next call to NewFrame(). this is what you have to render.
 Demo, Debug, Information
 create Demo window. demonstrate most ImGui features. call this to learn about the library! try to make it always available in your application!
 create Metrics/Debugger window. display Dear ImGui internals: windows, draw commands, various internal state, etc.
 create About window. display Dear ImGui version, credits and build/system information.
 add style editor block (not a window). you can pass in a reference ImGuiStyle structure to compare to, revert to and save to (else it uses the default style)
 add style selector block (not a window), essentially a combo listing the default styles.
 add font selector block (not a window), essentially a combo listing the loaded fonts.
 add basic help/info block (not a window): how to manipulate ImGui as a end-user (mouse/keyboard controls).
 get the compiled version string e.g. "1.80 WIP" (essentially the value for IMGUI_VERSION from the compiled version of imgui.cpp)
 Styles
 new, recommended style (default)
 best used with borders and a custom, thicker font
 classic imgui style
 Windows
 - Begin() = push window to the stack and start appending to it. End() = pop window from the stack.
 - Passing 'bool* p_open != NULL' shows a window-closing widget in the upper-right corner of the window,
   which clicking will set the boolean to false when clicked.
 - You may append multiple times to the same window during the same frame by calling Begin()/End() pairs multiple times.
   Some information such as 'flags' or 'p_open' will only be considered by the first call to Begin().
 - Begin() return false to indicate the window is collapsed or fully clipped, so you may early out and omit submitting
   anything to the window. Always call a matching End() for each Begin() call, regardless of its return value!
   [Important: due to legacy reason, this is inconsistent with most other functions such as BeginMenu/EndMenu,
    BeginPopup/EndPopup, etc. where the EndXXX call should only be called if the corresponding BeginXXX function
    returned true. Begin and BeginChild are the only odd ones out. Will be fixed in a future update.]
 - Note that the bottom of window stack always contains a window called "Debug".
 Child Windows
 - Use child windows to begin into a self-contained independent scrolling/clipping regions within a host window. Child windows can embed their own child.
 - For each independent axis of 'size': ==0.0f: use remaining host window size / >0.0f: fixed size / <0.0f: use remaining window size minus abs(size) / Each axis can use a different mode, e.g. ImVec2(0,400).
 - BeginChild() returns false to indicate the window is collapsed or fully clipped, so you may early out and omit submitting anything to the window.
   Always call a matching EndChild() for each BeginChild() call, regardless of its return value.
   [Important: due to legacy reason, this is inconsistent with most other functions such as BeginMenu/EndMenu,
    BeginPopup/EndPopup, etc. where the EndXXX call should only be called if the corresponding BeginXXX function
    returned true. Begin and BeginChild are the only odd ones out. Will be fixed in a future update.]
 Windows Utilities
 - 'current window' = the window we are appending into while inside a Begin()/End() block. 'next window' = next window we will Begin() into.
 is current window focused? or its root/child, depending on flags. see flags for options.
 is current window hovered (and typically: not blocked by a popup/modal)? see flags for options. NB: If you are trying to check whether your mouse should be dispatched to imgui or to your app, you should use the 'io.WantCaptureMouse' boolean for that! Please read the FAQ!
 get draw list associated to the current window, to append your own drawing primitives
 get current window position in screen space (useful if you want to do your own drawing via the DrawList API)
 get current window size
 get current window width (shortcut for GetWindowSize().x)
 get current window height (shortcut for GetWindowSize().y)
 Window manipulation
 - Prefer using SetNextXXX functions (before Begin) rather that SetXXX functions (after Begin).
 set next window position. call before Begin(). use pivot=(0.5f,0.5f) to center on given point, etc.
 set next window size. set axis to 0.0f to force an auto-fit on this axis. call before Begin()
 set next window size limits. use -1,-1 on either X/Y axis to preserve the current size. Sizes will be rounded down. Use callback to apply non-trivial programmatic constraints.
 set next window content size (~ scrollable client area, which enforce the range of scrollbars). Not including window decorations (title bar, menu bar, etc.) nor WindowPadding. set an axis to 0.0f to leave it automatic. call before Begin()
 set next window collapsed state. call before Begin()
 set next window to be focused / top-most. call before Begin()
 set next window background color alpha. helper to easily override the Alpha component of ImGuiCol_WindowBg/ChildBg/PopupBg. you may also use ImGuiWindowFlags_NoBackground.
 (not recommended) set current window position - call within Begin()/End(). prefer using SetNextWindowPos(), as this may incur tearing and side-effects.
 (not recommended) set current window size - call within Begin()/End(). set to ImVec2(0, 0) to force an auto-fit. prefer using SetNextWindowSize(), as this may incur tearing and minor side-effects.
 (not recommended) set current window collapsed state. prefer using SetNextWindowCollapsed().
 (not recommended) set current window to be focused / top-most. prefer using SetNextWindowFocus().
 [OBSOLETE] set font scale. Adjust IO.FontGlobalScale if you want to scale all windows. This is an old API! For correct scaling, prefer to reload font + rebuild ImFontAtlas + call style.ScaleAllSizes().
 set named window position.
 set named window size. set axis to 0.0f to force an auto-fit on this axis.
 set named window collapsed state
 set named window to be focused / top-most. use NULL to remove focus.
 Content region
 - Retrieve available space from a given point. GetContentRegionAvail() is frequently useful.
 - Those functions are bound to be redesigned (they are confusing, incomplete and the Min/Max return values are in local window coordinates which increases confusion)
 == GetContentRegionMax() - GetCursorPos()
 current content boundaries (typically window boundaries including scrolling, or current column boundaries), in windows coordinates
 content boundaries min (roughly (0,0)-Scroll), in window coordinates
 content boundaries max (roughly (0,0)+Size-Scroll) where Size can be override with SetNextWindowContentSize(), in window coordinates

 Windows Scrolling
 get scrolling amount [0 .. GetScrollMaxX()]
 get scrolling amount [0 .. GetScrollMaxY()]
 set scrolling amount [0 .. GetScrollMaxX()]
 set scrolling amount [0 .. GetScrollMaxY()]
 get maximum scrolling amount ~~ ContentSize.x - WindowSize.x - DecorationsSize.x
 get maximum scrolling amount ~~ ContentSize.y - WindowSize.y - DecorationsSize.y
 adjust scrolling amount to make current cursor position visible. center_x_ratio=0.0: left, 0.5: center, 1.0: right. When using to make a "default/current item" visible, consider using SetItemDefaultFocus() instead.
 adjust scrolling amount to make current cursor position visible. center_y_ratio=0.0: top, 0.5: center, 1.0: bottom. When using to make a "default/current item" visible, consider using SetItemDefaultFocus() instead.
 adjust scrolling amount to make given position visible. Generally GetCursorStartPos() + offset to compute a valid position.
 adjust scrolling amount to make given position visible. Generally GetCursorStartPos() + offset to compute a valid position.
 Parameters stacks (shared)
 use NULL as a shortcut to push default font
 modify a style color. always use this if you modify the style after NewFrame().
 modify a style float variable. always use this if you modify the style after NewFrame().
 modify a style ImVec2 variable. always use this if you modify the style after NewFrame().
 == tab stop enable. Allow focusing using TAB/Shift-TAB, enabled by default but you can disable it for certain widgets
 in 'repeat' mode, Button*() functions return repeated true in a typematic manner (using io.KeyRepeatDelay/io.KeyRepeatRate setting). Note that you can call IsItemActive() after any Button() to tell if the button is held in the current frame.
 Parameters stacks (current window)
 push width of items for common large "item+label" widgets. >0.0f: width in pixels, <0.0f align xx pixels to the right of window (so -FLT_MIN always align width to the right side).
 set width of the _next_ common large "item+label" widget. >0.0f: width in pixels, <0.0f align xx pixels to the right of window (so -FLT_MIN always align width to the right side)
 width of item given pushed settings and current cursor position. NOT necessarily the width of last item unlike most 'Item' functions.
 push word-wrapping position for Text*() commands. < 0.0f: no wrapping; 0.0f: wrap to end of window (or column); > 0.0f: wrap at 'wrap_pos_x' position in window local space
 Style read access
 - Use the style editor (ShowStyleEditor() function) to interactively see what the colors are)
 get current font
 get current font size (= height in pixels) of current font with current scale applied
 get UV coordinate for a while pixel, useful to draw custom shapes via the ImDrawList API
 retrieve given style color with style alpha applied and optional extra alpha multiplier, packed as a 32-bit value suitable for ImDrawList
 retrieve given color with style alpha applied, packed as a 32-bit value suitable for ImDrawList
 retrieve given color with style alpha applied, packed as a 32-bit value suitable for ImDrawList
 retrieve style color as stored in ImGuiStyle structure. use to feed back into PushStyleColor(), otherwise use GetColorU32() to get style color with style alpha baked in.
 Cursor / Layout
 - By "cursor" we mean the current output position.
 - The typical widget behavior is to output themselves at the current cursor position, then move the cursor one line down.
 - You can call SameLine() between widgets to undo the last carriage return and output at the right of the preceding widget.
 - Attention! We currently have inconsistencies between window-local and absolute positions we will aim to fix with future API:
    Window-local coordinates:   SameLine(), GetCursorPos(), SetCursorPos(), GetCursorStartPos(), GetContentRegionMax(), GetWindowContentRegion*(), PushTextWrapPos()
    Absolute coordinate:        GetCursorScreenPos(), SetCursorScreenPos(), all ImDrawList:: functions.
 separator, generally horizontal. inside a menu bar or in horizontal layout mode, this becomes a vertical separator.
 call between widgets or groups to layout them horizontally. X position given in window coordinates.
 undo a SameLine() or force a new line when in an horizontal-layout context.
 add vertical spacing.
 add a dummy item of given size. unlike InvisibleButton(), Dummy() won't take the mouse click or be navigable into.
 move content position toward the right, by indent_w, or style.IndentSpacing if indent_w <= 0
 move content position back to the left, by indent_w, or style.IndentSpacing if indent_w <= 0
 lock horizontal starting position
 unlock horizontal starting position + capture the whole group bounding box into one "item" (so you can use IsItemHovered() or layout primitives such as SameLine() on whole group, etc.)
 cursor position in window coordinates (relative to window position)
   (some functions are using window-relative coordinates, such as: GetCursorPos, GetCursorStartPos, GetContentRegionMax, GetWindowContentRegion* etc.
    other functions such as GetCursorScreenPos or everything in ImDrawList::
    are using the main, absolute coordinate system.
    GetWindowPos() + GetCursorPos() == GetCursorScreenPos() etc.)

 initial cursor position in window coordinates
 cursor position in absolute coordinates (useful to work with ImDrawList API). generally top-left == GetMainViewport()->Pos == (0,0) in single viewport mode, and bottom-right == GetMainViewport()->Pos+Size == io.DisplaySize in single-viewport mode.
 cursor position in absolute coordinates
 vertically align upcoming text baseline to FramePadding.y so that it will align properly to regularly framed items (call if you have text on a line before a framed item)
 ~ FontSize
 ~ FontSize + style.ItemSpacing.y (distance in pixels between 2 consecutive lines of text)
 ~ FontSize + style.FramePadding.y * 2
 ~ FontSize + style.FramePadding.y * 2 + style.ItemSpacing.y (distance in pixels between 2 consecutive lines of framed widgets)
 ID stack/scopes
dearimgui.org/faq) for more details about how ID are handled in dear imgui.
 - Those questions are answered and impacted by understanding of the ID stack system:
   - "Q: Why is my widget not reacting when I click on it?"
   - "Q: How can I have widgets with an empty label?"
   - "Q: How can I have multiple widgets with the same label?"
 - Short version: ID are hashes of the entire ID stack. If you are creating widgets in a loop you most likely
   want to push a unique identifier (e.g. object pointer, loop index) to uniquely differentiate them.
 - You can also use the "Label##foobar" syntax within widget label to distinguish them from each others.
 - In this header file we use the "label"/"name" terminology to denote a string that will be displayed + used as an ID,
   whereas "str_id" denote a string that is only used as an ID and not normally displayed.
 push string into the ID stack (will hash string).
 push string into the ID stack (will hash string).
 push pointer into the ID stack (will hash pointer).
 push integer into the ID stack (will hash integer).
 pop from the ID stack.
 calculate unique ID (hash of whole ID stack + given parameter). e.g. if you want to query into ImGuiStorage yourself
 Widgets: Text
 raw text without formatting. Roughly equivalent to Text("%s", text) but: A) doesn't require null terminated string if 'text_end' is specified, B) it's faster, no memory copy is done, no buffer size limits, recommended for long chunks of text.
 formatted text
 shortcut for PushStyleColor(ImGuiCol_Text, col); Text(fmt, ...); PopStyleColor();
 shortcut for PushStyleColor(ImGuiCol_Text, style.Colors[ImGuiCol_TextDisabled]); Text(fmt, ...); PopStyleColor();
 shortcut for PushTextWrapPos(0.0f); Text(fmt, ...); PopTextWrapPos();. Note that this won't work on an auto-resizing window if there's no other widgets to extend the window width, yoy may need to set a size using SetNextWindowSize().
 display text+label aligned the same way as value+label widgets
 shortcut for Bullet()+Text()
 Widgets: Main
 - Most widgets return true when the value has been changed or when pressed/selected
 - You may also use one of the many IsItemXXX functions (e.g. IsItemActive, IsItemHovered, etc.) to query widget state.
 button
 button with FramePadding=(0,0) to easily embed within text
 flexible button behavior without the visuals, frequently useful to build custom behaviors using the public api (along with IsItemActive, IsItemHovered, etc.)
 square button with an arrow shape
 <0 frame_padding uses default frame padding settings. 0 for no padding
 use with e.g. if (RadioButton("one", my_value==1)) { my_value = 1; }
 shortcut to handle the above pattern when value is an integer
 draw a small circle + keep the cursor on the same line. advance cursor x position by GetTreeNodeToLabelSpacing(), same distance that TreeNode() uses
 Widgets: Combo Box
 - The BeginCombo()/EndCombo() api allows you to manage your contents and selection state however you want it, by creating e.g. Selectable() items.
 - The old Combo() api are helpers over BeginCombo()/EndCombo() which are kept available for convenience purpose. This is analogous to how ListBox are created.
 only call EndCombo() if BeginCombo() returns true!
 Separate items with \0 within a string, end item-list with \0\0. e.g. "One\0Two\0Three\0"
 Widgets: Drag Sliders
 - CTRL+Click on any drag box to turn them into an input box. Manually input values aren't clamped and can go off-bounds.
 - For all the Float2/Float3/Float4/Int2/Int3/Int4 versions of every functions, note that a 'float v[X]' function argument is the same as 'float* v', the array syntax is just a way to document the number of elements that are expected to be accessible. You can pass address of your first element out of a contiguous set, e.g. &myvector.x
 - Adjust format string to decorate the value with a prefix, a suffix, or adapt the editing and display precision e.g. "%.3f" -> 1.234; "%5.2f secs" -> 01.23 secs; "Biscuit: %.0f" -> Biscuit: 1; etc.
 - Format string may also be set to NULL or use the default format ("%f" or "%d").
 - Speed are per-pixel of mouse movement (v_speed=0.2f: mouse needs to move by 5 pixels to increase value by 1). For gamepad/keyboard navigation, minimum speed is Max(v_speed, minimum_step_at_given_precision).
 - Use v_min < v_max to clamp edits to given limits. Note that CTRL+Click manual input can override those limits.
 - Use v_max = FLT_MAX / INT_MAX etc to avoid clamping to a maximum, same with v_min = -FLT_MAX / INT_MIN to avoid clamping to a minimum.
 - We use the same sets of flags for DragXXX() and SliderXXX() functions as the features are the same and it makes it easier to swap them.
 - Legacy: Pre-1.78 there are DragXXX() function signatures that takes a final `float power=1.0f' argument instead of the `ImGuiSliderFlags flags=0' argument.
github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/3361
 If v_min >= v_max we have no bound
 If v_min >= v_max we have no bound
 Widgets: Regular Sliders
 - CTRL+Click on any slider to turn them into an input box. Manually input values aren't clamped and can go off-bounds.
 - Adjust format string to decorate the value with a prefix, a suffix, or adapt the editing and display precision e.g. "%.3f" -> 1.234; "%5.2f secs" -> 01.23 secs; "Biscuit: %.0f" -> Biscuit: 1; etc.
 - Format string may also be set to NULL or use the default format ("%f" or "%d").
 - Legacy: Pre-1.78 there are SliderXXX() function signatures that takes a final `float power=1.0f' argument instead of the `ImGuiSliderFlags flags=0' argument.
github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/3361
 adjust format to decorate the value with a prefix or a suffix for in-slider labels or unit display.
 Widgets: Input with Keyboard
 - If you want to use InputText() with std::string or any custom dynamic string type, see misc/cpp/imgui_stdlib.h and comments in imgui_demo.cpp.
 - Most of the ImGuiInputTextFlags flags are only useful for InputText() and not for InputFloatX, InputIntX, InputDouble etc.
 Widgets: Color Editor/Picker (tip: the ColorEdit* functions have a little color square that can be left-clicked to open a picker, and right-clicked to open an option menu.)
 - Note that in C++ a 'float v[X]' function argument is the _same_ as 'float* v', the array syntax is just a way to document the number of elements that are expected to be accessible.
 - You can pass the address of a first float element out of a contiguous structure, e.g. &myvector.x
 display a color square/button, hover for details, return true when pressed.
 initialize current options (generally on application startup) if you want to select a default format, picker type, etc. User will be able to change many settings, unless you pass the _NoOptions flag to your calls.
 Widgets: Trees
 - TreeNode functions return true when the node is open, in which case you need to also call TreePop() when you are finished displaying the tree node contents.
 helper variation to easily decorelate the id from the displayed string. Read the FAQ about why and how to use ID. to align arbitrary text at the same level as a TreeNode() you can use Bullet().
 "
 ~ Indent()+PushId(). Already called by TreeNode() when returning true, but you can call TreePush/TreePop yourself if desired.
 "
 ~ Unindent()+PopId()
 horizontal distance preceding label when using TreeNode*() or Bullet() == (g.FontSize + style.FramePadding.x*2) for a regular unframed TreeNode
 if returning 'true' the header is open. doesn't indent nor push on ID stack. user doesn't have to call TreePop().
 when 'p_visible != NULL': if '*p_visible==true' display an additional small close button on upper right of the header which will set the bool to false when clicked, if '*p_visible==false' don't display the header.
 set next TreeNode/CollapsingHeader open state.
 Widgets: Selectables
 - A selectable highlights when hovered, and can display another color when selected.
 - Neighbors selectable extend their highlight bounds in order to leave no gap between them. This is so a series of selected Selectable appear contiguous.
 "bool selected" carry the selection state (read-only). Selectable() is clicked is returns true so you can modify your selection state. size.x==0.0: use remaining width, size.x>0.0: specify width. size.y==0.0: use label height, size.y>0.0: specify height
 "bool* p_selected" point to the selection state (read-write), as a convenient helper.
 Widgets: List Boxes
 - This is essentially a thin wrapper to using BeginChild/EndChild with some stylistic changes.
 - The BeginListBox()/EndListBox() api allows you to manage your contents and selection state however you want it, by creating e.g. Selectable() or any items.
 - The simplified/old ListBox() api are helpers over BeginListBox()/EndListBox() which are kept available for convenience purpose. This is analoguous to how Combos are created.
 - Choose frame width:   size.x > 0.0f: custom  /  size.x < 0.0f or -FLT_MIN: right-align   /  size.x = 0.0f (default): use current ItemWidth
 - Choose frame height:  size.y > 0.0f: custom  /  size.y < 0.0f or -FLT_MIN: bottom-align  /  size.y = 0.0f (default): arbitrary default height which can fit ~7 items
 open a framed scrolling region
 only call EndListBox() if BeginListBox() returned true!
 Widgets: Data Plotting
github.com/epezent/implot) which is much better!
 Widgets: Value() Helpers.
 - Those are merely shortcut to calling Text() with a format string. Output single value in "name: value" format (tip: freely declare more in your code to handle your types. you can add functions to the ImGui namespace)
 Widgets: Menus
 - Use BeginMenuBar() on a window ImGuiWindowFlags_MenuBar to append to its menu bar.
 - Use BeginMainMenuBar() to create a menu bar at the top of the screen and append to it.
 - Use BeginMenu() to create a menu. You can call BeginMenu() multiple time with the same identifier to append more items to it.
 - Not that MenuItem() keyboardshortcuts are displayed as a convenience but _not processed_ by Dear ImGui at the moment.
 append to menu-bar of current window (requires ImGuiWindowFlags_MenuBar flag set on parent window).
 only call EndMenuBar() if BeginMenuBar() returns true!
 create and append to a full screen menu-bar.
 only call EndMainMenuBar() if BeginMainMenuBar() returns true!
 create a sub-menu entry. only call EndMenu() if this returns true!
 only call EndMenu() if BeginMenu() returns true!
 return true when activated.
 return true when activated + toggle (*p_selected) if p_selected != NULL
 Tooltips
 - Tooltip are windows following the mouse. They do not take focus away.
 begin/append a tooltip window. to create full-featured tooltip (with any kind of items).
 set a text-only tooltip, typically use with ImGui::IsItemHovered(). override any previous call to SetTooltip().
 Popups, Modals
  - They block normal mouse hovering detection (and therefore most mouse interactions) behind them.
  - If not modal: they can be closed by clicking anywhere outside them, or by pressing ESCAPE.
  - Their visibility state (~bool) is held internally instead of being held by the programmer as we are used to with regular Begin*() calls.
  - The 3 properties above are related: we need to retain popup visibility state in the library because popups may be closed as any time.
  - You can bypass the hovering restriction by using ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup when calling IsItemHovered() or IsWindowHovered().
  - IMPORTANT: Popup identifiers are relative to the current ID stack, so OpenPopup and BeginPopup generally needs to be at the same level of the stack.
    This is sometimes leading to confusing mistakes. May rework this in the future.
 Popups: begin/end functions
  - BeginPopup(): query popup state, if open start appending into the window. Call EndPopup() afterwards. ImGuiWindowFlags are forwarded to the window.
  - BeginPopupModal(): block every interactions behind the window, cannot be closed by user, add a dimming background, has a title bar.
 return true if the popup is open, and you can start outputting to it.
 return true if the modal is open, and you can start outputting to it.
 only call EndPopup() if BeginPopupXXX() returns true!
 Popups: open/close functions
  - OpenPopup(): set popup state to open. ImGuiPopupFlags are available for opening options.
  - If not modal: they can be closed by clicking anywhere outside them, or by pressing ESCAPE.
  - CloseCurrentPopup(): use inside the BeginPopup()/EndPopup() scope to close manually.
  - CloseCurrentPopup() is called by default by Selectable()/MenuItem() when activated (FIXME: need some options).
  - Use ImGuiPopupFlags_NoOpenOverExistingPopup to avoid opening a popup if there's already one at the same level. This is equivalent to e.g. testing for !IsAnyPopupOpen() prior to OpenPopup().
  - Use IsWindowAppearing() after BeginPopup() to tell if a window just opened.
 call to mark popup as open (don't call every frame!).
 id overload to facilitate calling from nested stacks
 helper to open popup when clicked on last item. Default to ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonRight == 1. (note: actually triggers on the mouse _released_ event to be consistent with popup behaviors)
 manually close the popup we have begin-ed into.
 Popups: open+begin combined functions helpers
  - Helpers to do OpenPopup+BeginPopup where the Open action is triggered by e.g. hovering an item and right-clicking.
  - They are convenient to easily create context menus, hence the name.
  - IMPORTANT: Notice that BeginPopupContextXXX takes ImGuiPopupFlags just like OpenPopup() and unlike BeginPopup(). For full consistency, we may add ImGuiWindowFlags to the BeginPopupContextXXX functions in the future.
  - IMPORTANT: we exceptionally default their flags to 1 (== ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonRight) for backward compatibility with older API taking 'int mouse_button = 1' parameter, so if you add other flags remember to re-add the ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonRight.
 open+begin popup when clicked on last item. Use str_id==NULL to associate the popup to previous item. If you want to use that on a non-interactive item such as Text() you need to pass in an explicit ID here. read comments in .cpp!
 open+begin popup when clicked on current window.
 open+begin popup when clicked in void (where there are no windows).
 Popups: query functions
  - IsPopupOpen(): return true if the popup is open at the current BeginPopup() level of the popup stack.
  - IsPopupOpen() with ImGuiPopupFlags_AnyPopupId: return true if any popup is open at the current BeginPopup() level of the popup stack.
  - IsPopupOpen() with ImGuiPopupFlags_AnyPopupId + ImGuiPopupFlags_AnyPopupLevel: return true if any popup is open.
 return true if the popup is open.
 Tables
 [BETA API] API may evolve slightly! If you use this, please update to the next version when it comes out!
 - Full-featured replacement for old Columns API.
 - See Demo->Tables for demo code.
 - See top of imgui_tables.cpp for general commentary.
 - See ImGuiTableFlags_ and ImGuiTableColumnFlags_ enums for a description of available flags.
 The typical call flow is:
 - 1. Call BeginTable().
 - 2. Optionally call TableSetupColumn() to submit column name/flags/defaults.
 - 3. Optionally call TableSetupScrollFreeze() to request scroll freezing of columns/rows.
 - 4. Optionally call TableHeadersRow() to submit a header row. Names are pulled from TableSetupColumn() data.
 - 5. Populate contents:
    - In most situations you can use TableNextRow() + TableSetColumnIndex(N) to start appending into a column.
    - If you are using tables as a sort of grid, where every columns is holding the same type of contents,
      you may prefer using TableNextColumn() instead of TableNextRow() + TableSetColumnIndex().
      TableNextColumn() will automatically wrap-around into the next row if needed.
    - IMPORTANT: Comparatively to the old Columns() API, we need to call TableNextColumn() for the first column!
    - Summary of possible call flow:
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 OK
 OK
 OK: TableNextColumn() automatically gets to next row!
 Not OK! Missing TableSetColumnIndex() or TableNextColumn()! Text will not appear!
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - 5. Call EndTable()
 only call EndTable() if BeginTable() returns true!
 append into the first cell of a new row.
 append into the next column (or first column of next row if currently in last column). Return true when column is visible.
 append into the specified column. Return true when column is visible.
 Tables: Headers & Columns declaration
 - Use TableSetupColumn() to specify label, resizing policy, default width/weight, id, various other flags etc.
 - Use TableHeadersRow() to create a header row and automatically submit a TableHeader() for each column.
   Headers are required to perform: reordering, sorting, and opening the context menu.
   The context menu can also be made available in columns body using ImGuiTableFlags_ContextMenuInBody.
 - You may manually submit headers using TableNextRow() + TableHeader() calls, but this is only useful in
   some advanced use cases (e.g. adding custom widgets in header row).
 - Use TableSetupScrollFreeze() to lock columns/rows so they stay visible when scrolled.
 lock columns/rows so they stay visible when scrolled.
 submit all headers cells based on data provided to TableSetupColumn() + submit context menu
 submit one header cell manually (rarely used)
 Tables: Sorting
 - Call TableGetSortSpecs() to retrieve latest sort specs for the table. NULL when not sorting.
 - When 'SpecsDirty == true' you should sort your data. It will be true when sorting specs have changed
   since last call, or the first time. Make sure to set 'SpecsDirty = false' after sorting, else you may
   wastefully sort your data every frame!
 - Lifetime: don't hold on this pointer over multiple frames or past any subsequent call to BeginTable().
 get latest sort specs for the table (NULL if not sorting).
 Tables: Miscellaneous functions
 - Functions args 'int column_n' treat the default value of -1 as the same as passing the current column index.
 return number of columns (value passed to BeginTable)
 return current column index.
 return current row index.
 return "" if column didn't have a name declared by TableSetupColumn(). Pass -1 to use current column.
 return column flags so you can query their Enabled/Visible/Sorted/Hovered status flags. Pass -1 to use current column.
 change user accessible enabled/disabled state of a column. Set to false to hide the column. User can use the context menu to change this themselves (right-click in headers, or right-click in columns body with ImGuiTableFlags_ContextMenuInBody)
 change the color of a cell, row, or column. See ImGuiTableBgTarget_ flags for details.
 Legacy Columns API (prefer using Tables!)
 - You can also use SameLine(pos_x) to mimic simplified columns.
 next column, defaults to current row or next row if the current row is finished
 get current column index
 get column width (in pixels). pass -1 to use current column
 set column width (in pixels). pass -1 to use current column
 get position of column line (in pixels, from the left side of the contents region). pass -1 to use current column, otherwise 0..GetColumnsCount() inclusive. column 0 is typically 0.0f
 set position of column line (in pixels, from the left side of the contents region). pass -1 to use current column
 Tab Bars, Tabs
 create and append into a TabBar
 only call EndTabBar() if BeginTabBar() returns true!
 create a Tab. Returns true if the Tab is selected.
 only call EndTabItem() if BeginTabItem() returns true!
 create a Tab behaving like a button. return true when clicked. cannot be selected in the tab bar.
 notify TabBar or Docking system of a closed tab/window ahead (useful to reduce visual flicker on reorderable tab bars). For tab-bar: call after BeginTabBar() and before Tab submissions. Otherwise call with a window name.
 Logging/Capture
 - All text output from the interface can be captured into tty/file/clipboard. By default, tree nodes are automatically opened during logging.
 start logging to tty (stdout)
 start logging to file
 start logging to OS clipboard
 stop logging (close file, etc.)
 helper to display buttons for logging to tty/file/clipboard
 pass text data straight to log (without being displayed)
 Drag and Drop
 - On source items, call BeginDragDropSource(), if it returns true also call SetDragDropPayload() + EndDragDropSource().
 - On target candidates, call BeginDragDropTarget(), if it returns true also call AcceptDragDropPayload() + EndDragDropTarget().
 - If you stop calling BeginDragDropSource() the payload is preserved however it won't have a preview tooltip (we currently display a fallback "..." tooltip, see #1725)
 - An item can be both drag source and drop target.
 call after submitting an item which may be dragged. when this return true, you can call SetDragDropPayload() + EndDragDropSource()
 type is a user defined string of maximum 32 characters. Strings starting with '_' are reserved for dear imgui internal types. Data is copied and held by imgui.
 only call EndDragDropSource() if BeginDragDropSource() returns true!
 call after submitting an item that may receive a payload. If this returns true, you can call AcceptDragDropPayload() + EndDragDropTarget()
 accept contents of a given type. If ImGuiDragDropFlags_AcceptBeforeDelivery is set you can peek into the payload before the mouse button is released.
 only call EndDragDropTarget() if BeginDragDropTarget() returns true!
 peek directly into the current payload from anywhere. may return NULL. use ImGuiPayload::IsDataType() to test for the payload type.
 Disabling [BETA API]
 - Disable all user interactions and dim items visuals (applying style.DisabledAlpha over current colors)
 - BeginDisabled(false) essentially does nothing useful but is provided to facilitate use of boolean expressions. If you can avoid calling BeginDisabled(False)/EndDisabled() best to avoid it.
 Clipping
 - Mouse hovering is affected by ImGui::PushClipRect() calls, unlike direct calls to ImDrawList::PushClipRect() which are render only.
 Focus, Activation
 - Prefer using "SetItemDefaultFocus()" over "if (IsWindowAppearing()) SetScrollHereY()" when applicable to signify "this is the default item"
 make last item the default focused item of a window.
 focus keyboard on the next widget. Use positive 'offset' to access sub components of a multiple component widget. Use -1 to access previous widget.
 Item/Widgets Utilities and Query Functions
 - Most of the functions are referring to the previous Item that has been submitted.
 - See Demo Window under "Widgets->Querying Status" for an interactive visualization of most of those functions.
 is the last item hovered? (and usable, aka not blocked by a popup, etc.). See ImGuiHoveredFlags for more options.
 is the last item active? (e.g. button being held, text field being edited. This will continuously return true while holding mouse button on an item. Items that don't interact will always return false)
 is the last item focused for keyboard/gamepad navigation?
 is the last item hovered and mouse clicked on? (**)  == IsMouseClicked(mouse_button) && IsItemHovered()Important. (**) this it NOT equivalent to the behavior of e.g. Button(). Read comments in function definition.
 is the last item visible? (items may be out of sight because of clipping/scrolling)
 did the last item modify its underlying value this frame? or was pressed? This is generally the same as the "bool" return value of many widgets.
 was the last item just made active (item was previously inactive).
 was the last item just made inactive (item was previously active). Useful for Undo/Redo patterns with widgets that requires continuous editing.
 was the last item just made inactive and made a value change when it was active? (e.g. Slider/Drag moved). Useful for Undo/Redo patterns with widgets that requires continuous editing. Note that you may get false positives (some widgets such as Combo()/ListBox()/Selectable() will return true even when clicking an already selected item).
 was the last item open state toggled? set by TreeNode().
 is any item hovered?
 is any item active?
 is any item focused?
 get upper-left bounding rectangle of the last item (screen space)
 get lower-right bounding rectangle of the last item (screen space)
 get size of last item
 allow last item to be overlapped by a subsequent item. sometimes useful with invisible buttons, selectables, etc. to catch unused area.
 Viewports
 - Currently represents the Platform Window created by the application which is hosting our Dear ImGui windows.
 - In 'docking' branch with multi-viewport enabled, we extend this concept to have multiple active viewports.
 - In the future we will extend this concept further to also represent Platform Monitor and support a "no main platform window" operation mode.
 return primary/default viewport. This can never be NULL.
 Miscellaneous Utilities
 test if rectangle (of given size, starting from cursor position) is visible / not clipped.
 test if rectangle (in screen space) is visible / not clipped. to perform coarse clipping on user's side.
 get global imgui time. incremented by io.DeltaTime every frame.
 get global imgui frame count. incremented by 1 every frame.
 this draw list will be the first rendering one. Useful to quickly draw shapes/text behind dear imgui contents.
 this draw list will be the last rendered one. Useful to quickly draw shapes/text over dear imgui contents.
 you may use this when creating your own ImDrawList instances.
 get a string corresponding to the enum value (for display, saving, etc.).
 replace current window storage with our own (if you want to manipulate it yourself, typically clear subsection of it)
 calculate coarse clipping for large list of evenly sized items. Prefer using the ImGuiListClipper higher-level helper if you can.
 helper to create a child window / scrolling region that looks like a normal widget frame
 always call EndChildFrame() regardless of BeginChildFrame() return values (which indicates a collapsed/clipped window)
 Text Utilities
 Color Utilities
 Inputs Utilities: Keyboard
 - For 'int user_key_index' you can use your own indices/enums according to how your backend/engine stored them in io.KeysDown[].
 - We don't know the meaning of those value. You can use GetKeyIndex() to map a ImGuiKey_ value into the user index.
 map ImGuiKey_* values into user's key index. == io.KeyMap[key]
 is key being held. == io.KeysDown[user_key_index].
 was key pressed (went from !Down to Down)? if repeat=true, uses io.KeyRepeatDelay / KeyRepeatRate
 was key released (went from Down to !Down)?
 uses provided repeat rate/delay. return a count, most often 0 or 1 but might be >1 if RepeatRate is small enough that DeltaTime > RepeatRate
 attention: misleading name! manually override io.WantCaptureKeyboard flag next frame (said flag is entirely left for your application to handle). e.g. force capture keyboard when your widget is being hovered. This is equivalent to setting "io.WantCaptureKeyboard = want_capture_keyboard_value"; after the next NewFrame() call.
 Inputs Utilities: Mouse
 - To refer to a mouse button, you may use named enums in your code e.g. ImGuiMouseButton_Left, ImGuiMouseButton_Right.
 - You can also use regular integer: it is forever guaranteed that 0=Left, 1=Right, 2=Middle.
 - Dragging operations are only reported after mouse has moved a certain distance away from the initial clicking position (see 'lock_threshold' and 'io.MouseDraggingThreshold')
 is mouse button held?
 did mouse button clicked? (went from !Down to Down)
 did mouse button released? (went from Down to !Down)
 did mouse button double-clicked? (note that a double-click will also report IsMouseClicked() == true)
 is mouse hovering given bounding rect (in screen space). clipped by current clipping settings, but disregarding of other consideration of focus/window ordering/popup-block.
 by convention we use (-FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX) to denote that there is no mouse available
 is any mouse button held?
 shortcut to ImGui::GetIO().MousePos provided by user, to be consistent with other calls
 retrieve mouse position at the time of opening popup we have BeginPopup() into (helper to avoid user backing that value themselves)
 is mouse dragging? (if lock_threshold < -1.0f, uses io.MouseDraggingThreshold)
 return the delta from the initial clicking position while the mouse button is pressed or was just released. This is locked and return 0.0f until the mouse moves past a distance threshold at least once (if lock_threshold < -1.0f, uses io.MouseDraggingThreshold)

 get desired cursor type, reset in ImGui::NewFrame(), this is updated during the frame. valid before Render(). If you use software rendering by setting io.MouseDrawCursor ImGui will render those for you
 set desired cursor type
 attention: misleading name! manually override io.WantCaptureMouse flag next frame (said flag is entirely left for your application to handle). This is equivalent to setting "io.WantCaptureMouse = want_capture_mouse_value;" after the next NewFrame() call.
 Clipboard Utilities
 - Also see the LogToClipboard() function to capture GUI into clipboard, or easily output text data to the clipboard.
 Settings/.Ini Utilities
 - The disk functions are automatically called if io.IniFilename != NULL (default is "imgui.ini").
 - Set io.IniFilename to NULL to load/save manually. Read io.WantSaveIniSettings description about handling .ini saving manually.
 - Important: default value "imgui.ini" is relative to current working dir! Most apps will want to lock this to an absolute path (e.g. same path as executables).
 call after CreateContext() and before the first call to NewFrame(). NewFrame() automatically calls LoadIniSettingsFromDisk(io.IniFilename).
 call after CreateContext() and before the first call to NewFrame() to provide .ini data from your own data source.
 this is automatically called (if io.IniFilename is not empty) a few seconds after any modification that should be reflected in the .ini file (and also by DestroyContext).
 return a zero-terminated string with the .ini data which you can save by your own mean. call when io.WantSaveIniSettings is set, then save data by your own mean and clear io.WantSaveIniSettings.
 Debug Utilities
 - This is used by the IMGUI_CHECKVERSION() macro.
 This is called by IMGUI_CHECKVERSION() macro.
 Memory Allocators
 - Those functions are not reliant on the current context.
 - DLL users: heaps and globals are not shared across DLL boundaries! You will need to call SetCurrentContext() + SetAllocatorFunctions()
   for each static/DLL boundary you are calling from. Read "Context and Memory Allocators" section of imgui.cpp for more details.

 [SECTION] Flags & Enumerations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Flags for ImGui::Begin()
 Disable title-bar
 Disable user resizing with the lower-right grip
 Disable user moving the window
 Disable scrollbars (window can still scroll with mouse or programmatically)
 Disable user vertically scrolling with mouse wheel. On child window, mouse wheel will be forwarded to the parent unless NoScrollbar is also set.
 Disable user collapsing window by double-clicking on it
 Resize every window to its content every frame
 Disable drawing background color (WindowBg, etc.) and outside border. Similar as using SetNextWindowBgAlpha(0.0f).
 Never load/save settings in .ini file
 Disable catching mouse, hovering test with pass through.
 Has a menu-bar
 Allow horizontal scrollbar to appear (off by default). You may use SetNextWindowContentSize(ImVec2(width,0.0f)); prior to calling Begin() to specify width. Read code in imgui_demo in the "Horizontal Scrolling" section.
 Disable taking focus when transitioning from hidden to visible state
 Disable bringing window to front when taking focus (e.g. clicking on it or programmatically giving it focus)
 Always show vertical scrollbar (even if ContentSize.y < Size.y)
 Always show horizontal scrollbar (even if ContentSize.x < Size.x)
 Ensure child windows without border uses style.WindowPadding (ignored by default for non-bordered child windows, because more convenient)
 No gamepad/keyboard navigation within the window
 No focusing toward this window with gamepad/keyboard navigation (e.g. skipped by CTRL+TAB)
 Display a dot next to the title. When used in a tab/docking context, tab is selected when clicking the X + closure is not assumed (will wait for user to stop submitting the tab). Otherwise closure is assumed when pressing the X, so if you keep submitting the tab may reappear at end of tab bar.
 [Internal]
 [BETA] Allow gamepad/keyboard navigation to cross over parent border to this child (only use on child that have no scrolling!)
 Don't use! For internal use by BeginChild()
 Don't use! For internal use by BeginTooltip()
 Don't use! For internal use by BeginPopup()
 Don't use! For internal use by BeginPopupModal()
 Don't use! For internal use by BeginMenu()

 Turn a..z into A..Z
 Filter out spaces, tabs
 Select entire text when first taking mouse focus
 Return 'true' when Enter is pressed (as opposed to every time the value was modified). Consider looking at the IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit() function.
 Callback on pressing TAB (for completion handling)
 Callback on pressing Up/Down arrows (for history handling)
 Callback on each iteration. User code may query cursor position, modify text buffer.
 Callback on character inputs to replace or discard them. Modify 'EventChar' to replace or discard, or return 1 in callback to discard.

 Disable following the cursor horizontally
 Overwrite mode
 Read-only mode
 Password mode, display all characters as '*'
 Disable undo/redo. Note that input text owns the text data while active, if you want to provide your own undo/redo stack you need e.g. to call ClearActiveID().
 Allow 0123456789.+-*/eE (Scientific notation input)
 Callback on buffer capacity changes request (beyond 'buf_size' parameter value), allowing the string to grow. Notify when the string wants to be resized (for string types which hold a cache of their Size). You will be provided a new BufSize in the callback and NEED to honor it. (see misc/cpp/imgui_stdlib.h for an example of using this)
 Callback on any edit (note that InputText() already returns true on edit, the callback is useful mainly to manipulate the underlying buffer while focus is active)
 Obsolete names (will be removed soon)

 Flags for ImGui::TreeNodeEx(), ImGui::CollapsingHeader*()
 Draw as selected
 Draw frame with background (e.g. for CollapsingHeader)
 Hit testing to allow subsequent widgets to overlap this one
 Don't do a TreePush() when open (e.g. for CollapsingHeader) = no extra indent nor pushing on ID stack
 Don't automatically and temporarily open node when Logging is active (by default logging will automatically open tree nodes)
 Default node to be open
 Need double-click to open node
 Only open when clicking on the arrow part. If ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_OpenOnDoubleClick is also set, single-click arrow or double-click all box to open.
 No collapsing, no arrow (use as a convenience for leaf nodes).
 Display a bullet instead of arrow
 Use FramePadding (even for an unframed text node) to vertically align text baseline to regular widget height. Equivalent to calling AlignTextToFramePadding().
 Extend hit box to the right-most edge, even if not framed. This is not the default in order to allow adding other items on the same line. In the future we may refactor the hit system to be front-to-back, allowing natural overlaps and then this can become the default.
 Extend hit box to the left-most and right-most edges (bypass the indented area).
 (WIP) Nav: left direction may move to this TreeNode() from any of its child (items submitted between TreeNode and TreePop)
 FIXME: TODO: Disable automatic scroll on TreePop() if node got just open and contents is not visible
 Flags for OpenPopup*(), BeginPopupContext*(), IsPopupOpen() functions.
 - To be backward compatible with older API which took an 'int mouse_button = 1' argument, we need to treat
   small flags values as a mouse button index, so we encode the mouse button in the first few bits of the flags.
   It is therefore guaranteed to be legal to pass a mouse button index in ImGuiPopupFlags.
 - For the same reason, we exceptionally default the ImGuiPopupFlags argument of BeginPopupContextXXX functions to 1 instead of 0.
   IMPORTANT: because the default parameter is 1 (==ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonRight), if you rely on the default parameter
   and want to another another flag, you need to pass in the ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonRight flag.
 - Multiple buttons currently cannot be combined/or-ed in those functions (we could allow it later).
 For BeginPopupContext*(): open on Left Mouse release. Guaranteed to always be == 0 (same as ImGuiMouseButton_Left)
 For BeginPopupContext*(): open on Right Mouse release. Guaranteed to always be == 1 (same as ImGuiMouseButton_Right)
 For BeginPopupContext*(): open on Middle Mouse release. Guaranteed to always be == 2 (same as ImGuiMouseButton_Middle)
 For OpenPopup*(), BeginPopupContext*(): don't open if there's already a popup at the same level of the popup stack
 For BeginPopupContextWindow(): don't return true when hovering items, only when hovering empty space
 For IsPopupOpen(): ignore the ImGuiID parameter and test for any popup.
 For IsPopupOpen(): search/test at any level of the popup stack (default test in the current level)
 Flags for ImGui::Selectable()
 Clicking this don't close parent popup window
 Selectable frame can span all columns (text will still fit in current column)
 Generate press events on double clicks too
 Cannot be selected, display grayed out text
 (WIP) Hit testing to allow subsequent widgets to overlap this one
 Flags for ImGui::BeginCombo()
 Align the popup toward the left by default
 Max ~4 items visible. Tip: If you want your combo popup to be a specific size you can use SetNextWindowSizeConstraints() prior to calling BeginCombo()
 Max ~8 items visible (default)
 Max ~20 items visible
 As many fitting items as possible
 Display on the preview box without the square arrow button

 [BETA API] API may evolve slightly! If you use this, please update to the next version when it comes out!
 - Important! Sizing policies have complex and subtle side effects, more so than you would expect.
   Read comments/demos carefully + experiment with live demos to get acquainted with them.
 - The DEFAULT sizing policies are:
    - Default to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingFixedFit    if ScrollX is on, or if host window has ImGuiWindowFlags_AlwaysAutoResize.
    - Default to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingStretchSame if ScrollX is off.
 - When ScrollX is off:
    - Table defaults to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingStretchSame -> all Columns defaults to ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthStretch with same weight.
    - Columns sizing policy allowed: Stretch (default), Fixed/Auto.
    - Fixed Columns will generally obtain their requested width (unless the table cannot fit them all).
    - Stretch Columns will share the remaining width.
    - Mixed Fixed/Stretch columns is possible but has various side-effects on resizing behaviors.
      The typical use of mixing sizing policies is: any number of LEADING Fixed columns, followed by one or two TRAILING Stretch columns.
      (this is because the visible order of columns have subtle but necessary effects on how they react to manual resizing).
 - When ScrollX is on:
    - Table defaults to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingFixedFit -> all Columns defaults to ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthFixed
    - Columns sizing policy allowed: Fixed/Auto mostly.
    - Fixed Columns can be enlarged as needed. Table will show an horizontal scrollbar if needed.
    - When using auto-resizing (non-resizable) fixed columns, querying the content width to use item right-alignment e.g. SetNextItemWidth(-FLT_MIN) doesn't make sense, would create a feedback loop.
    - Using Stretch columns OFTEN DOES NOT MAKE SENSE if ScrollX is on, UNLESS you have specified a value for 'inner_width' in BeginTable().
      If you specify a value for 'inner_width' then effectively the scrolling space is known and Stretch or mixed Fixed/Stretch columns become meaningful again.
 - Read on documentation at the top of imgui_tables.cpp for details.
 Features
 Enable resizing columns.
 Enable reordering columns in header row (need calling TableSetupColumn() + TableHeadersRow() to display headers)
 Enable hiding/disabling columns in context menu.
 Enable sorting. Call TableGetSortSpecs() to obtain sort specs. Also see ImGuiTableFlags_SortMulti and ImGuiTableFlags_SortTristate.
 Disable persisting columns order, width and sort settings in the .ini file.
 Right-click on columns body/contents will display table context menu. By default it is available in TableHeadersRow().
 Decorations
 Set each RowBg color with ImGuiCol_TableRowBg or ImGuiCol_TableRowBgAlt (equivalent of calling TableSetBgColor with ImGuiTableBgFlags_RowBg0 on each row manually)
 Draw horizontal borders between rows.
 Draw horizontal borders at the top and bottom.
 Draw vertical borders between columns.
 Draw vertical borders on the left and right sides.
 Draw horizontal borders.
 Draw vertical borders.
 Draw inner borders.
 Draw outer borders.
 Draw all borders.
 [ALPHA] Disable vertical borders in columns Body (borders will always appears in Headers). -> May move to style
 [ALPHA] Disable vertical borders in columns Body until hovered for resize (borders will always appears in Headers). -> May move to style
 Sizing Policy (read above for defaults)
 Columns default to _WidthFixed or _WidthAuto (if resizable or not resizable), matching contents width.
 Columns default to _WidthFixed or _WidthAuto (if resizable or not resizable), matching the maximum contents width of all columns. Implicitly enable ImGuiTableFlags_NoKeepColumnsVisible.
 Columns default to _WidthStretch with default weights proportional to each columns contents widths.
 Columns default to _WidthStretch with default weights all equal, unless overridden by TableSetupColumn().
 Sizing Extra Options
 Make outer width auto-fit to columns, overriding outer_size.x value. Only available when ScrollX/ScrollY are disabled and Stretch columns are not used.
 Make outer height stop exactly at outer_size.y (prevent auto-extending table past the limit). Only available when ScrollX/ScrollY are disabled. Data below the limit will be clipped and not visible.
 Disable keeping column always minimally visible when ScrollX is off and table gets too small. Not recommended if columns are resizable.
 Disable distributing remainder width to stretched columns (width allocation on a 100-wide table with 3 columns: Without this flag: 33,33,34. With this flag: 33,33,33). With larger number of columns, resizing will appear to be less smooth.
 Clipping
 Disable clipping rectangle for every individual columns (reduce draw command count, items will be able to overflow into other columns). Generally incompatible with TableSetupScrollFreeze().
 Padding
 Default if BordersOuterV is on. Enable outer-most padding. Generally desirable if you have headers.
 Default if BordersOuterV is off. Disable outer-most padding.
 Disable inner padding between columns (double inner padding if BordersOuterV is on, single inner padding if BordersOuterV is off).
 Scrolling
 Enable horizontal scrolling. Require 'outer_size' parameter of BeginTable() to specify the container size. Changes default sizing policy. Because this create a child window, ScrollY is currently generally recommended when using ScrollX.
 Enable vertical scrolling. Require 'outer_size' parameter of BeginTable() to specify the container size.
 Sorting
 Hold shift when clicking headers to sort on multiple column. TableGetSortSpecs() may return specs where (SpecsCount > 1).
 Allow no sorting, disable default sorting. TableGetSortSpecs() may return specs where (SpecsCount == 0).

 Overriding/master disable flag: hide column, won't show in context menu (unlike calling TableSetColumnEnabled() which manipulates the user accessible state)
 Default as a hidden/disabled column.
 Default as a sorting column.
 Column will stretch. Preferable with horizontal scrolling disabled (default if table sizing policy is _SizingStretchSame or _SizingStretchProp).
 Column will not stretch. Preferable with horizontal scrolling enabled (default if table sizing policy is _SizingFixedFit and table is resizable).
 Disable manual resizing.

 Disable ability to hide/disable this column.
 Disable clipping for this column (all NoClip columns will render in a same draw command).
 Disable ability to sort on this field (even if ImGuiTableFlags_Sortable is set on the table).
 Disable ability to sort in the ascending direction.

 TableHeadersRow() will not submit label for this column. Convenient for some small columns. Name will still appear in context menu.
 Disable header text width contribution to automatic column width.
 Make the initial sort direction Ascending when first sorting on this column (default).
 Make the initial sort direction Descending when first sorting on this column.
 Use current Indent value when entering cell (default for column 0).
 Ignore current Indent value when entering cell (default for columns > 0). Indentation changes _within_ the cell will still be honored.
 Output status flags, read-only via TableGetColumnFlags()
 Status: is enabled == not hidden by user/api (referred to as "Hide" in _DefaultHide and _NoHide) flags.
 Status: is visible == is enabled AND not clipped by scrolling.
 Status: is currently part of the sort specs
 Status: is hovered by mouse
 [Internal] Combinations and masks
 [Internal] Disable user resizing this column directly (it may however we resized indirectly from its left edge)
 Obsolete names (will be removed soon)
 Column will not stretch and keep resizing based on submitted contents.
 Flags for ImGui::TableNextRow()
 Identify header row (set default background color + width of its contents accounted different for auto column width)
 Enum for ImGui::TableSetBgColor()
 Background colors are rendering in 3 layers:
  - Layer 0: draw with RowBg0 color if set, otherwise draw with ColumnBg0 if set.
  - Layer 1: draw with RowBg1 color if set, otherwise draw with ColumnBg1 if set.
  - Layer 2: draw with CellBg color if set.
 The purpose of the two row/columns layers is to let you decide if a background color changes should override or blend with the existing color.
 When using ImGuiTableFlags_RowBg on the table, each row has the RowBg0 color automatically set for odd/even rows.
 If you set the color of RowBg0 target, your color will override the existing RowBg0 color.
 If you set the color of RowBg1 or ColumnBg1 target, your color will blend over the RowBg0 color.
 Set row background color 0 (generally used for background, automatically set when ImGuiTableFlags_RowBg is used)
 Set row background color 1 (generally used for selection marking)
 Set cell background color (top-most color)
 Flags for ImGui::IsWindowFocused()
 IsWindowFocused(): Return true if any children of the window is focused
 IsWindowFocused(): Test from root window (top most parent of the current hierarchy)
 IsWindowFocused(): Return true if any window is focused. Important: If you are trying to tell how to dispatch your low-level inputs, do NOT use this. Use 'io.WantCaptureMouse' instead! Please read the FAQ!
 Flags for ImGui::IsItemHovered(), ImGui::IsWindowHovered()
 Note: if you are trying to check whether your mouse should be dispatched to Dear ImGui or to your app, you should use 'io.WantCaptureMouse' instead! Please read the FAQ!
 Note: windows with the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs flag are ignored by IsWindowHovered() calls.
 Return true if directly over the item/window, not obstructed by another window, not obstructed by an active popup or modal blocking inputs under them.
 IsWindowHovered() only: Return true if any children of the window is hovered
 IsWindowHovered() only: Test from root window (top most parent of the current hierarchy)
 IsWindowHovered() only: Return true if any window is hovered
 Return true even if a popup window is normally blocking access to this item/window
 Return true even if a modal popup window is normally blocking access to this item/window. FIXME-TODO: Unavailable yet.
 Return true even if an active item is blocking access to this item/window. Useful for Drag and Drop patterns.
 Return true even if the position is obstructed or overlapped by another window
 Return true even if the item is disabled
 Flags for ImGui::BeginDragDropSource(), ImGui::AcceptDragDropPayload()
 BeginDragDropSource() flags
 By default, a successful call to BeginDragDropSource opens a tooltip so you can display a preview or description of the source contents. This flag disable this behavior.
 By default, when dragging we clear data so that IsItemHovered() will return false, to avoid subsequent user code submitting tooltips. This flag disable this behavior so you can still call IsItemHovered() on the source item.
 Disable the behavior that allows to open tree nodes and collapsing header by holding over them while dragging a source item.
 Allow items such as Text(), Image() that have no unique identifier to be used as drag source, by manufacturing a temporary identifier based on their window-relative position. This is extremely unusual within the dear imgui ecosystem and so we made it explicit.
 External source (from outside of dear imgui), won't attempt to read current item/window info. Will always return true. Only one Extern source can be active simultaneously.
 Automatically expire the payload if the source cease to be submitted (otherwise payloads are persisting while being dragged)
 AcceptDragDropPayload() flags
 AcceptDragDropPayload() will returns true even before the mouse button is released. You can then call IsDelivery() to test if the payload needs to be delivered.
 Do not draw the default highlight rectangle when hovering over target.
 Request hiding the BeginDragDropSource tooltip from the BeginDragDropTarget site.
 For peeking ahead and inspecting the payload before delivery.
 Standard Drag and Drop payload types. You can define you own payload types using short strings. Types starting with '_' are defined by Dear ImGui.
 float[3]: Standard type for colors, without alpha. User code may use this type.
 float[4]: Standard type for colors. User code may use this type.

 To test io.KeyMods (which is a combination of individual fields io.KeyCtrl, io.KeyShift, io.KeyAlt set by user/backend)
 Gamepad/Keyboard navigation
 Keyboard: Set io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard to enable. NewFrame() will automatically fill io.NavInputs[] based on your io.KeysDown[] + io.KeyMap[] arrays.
 Gamepad:  Set io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad to enable. Backend: set ImGuiBackendFlags_HasGamepad and fill the io.NavInputs[] fields before calling NewFrame(). Note that io.NavInputs[] is cleared by EndFrame().

 e.g. Cross  (PS4), A (Xbox), A (Switch), Space (Keyboard)
 e.g. Circle (PS4), B (Xbox), B (Switch), Escape (Keyboard)
 e.g. Triang.(PS4), Y (Xbox), X (Switch), Return (Keyboard)
 e.g. Square (PS4), X (Xbox), Y (Switch), Alt (Keyboard)
 e.g. D-pad Left/Right/Up/Down (Gamepads), Arrow keys (Keyboard)



 e.g. Left Analog Stick Left/Right/Up/Down



 e.g. L1 or L2 (PS4), LB or LT (Xbox), L or ZL (Switch)
 e.g. R1 or R2 (PS4), RB or RT (Xbox), R or ZL (Switch)
 e.g. L1 or L2 (PS4), LB or LT (Xbox), L or ZL (Switch)

 [Internal] Don't use directly! This is used internally to differentiate keyboard from gamepad inputs for behaviors that require to differentiate them.
 Keyboard behavior that have no corresponding gamepad mapping (e.g. CTRL+TAB) will be directly reading from io.KeysDown[] instead of io.NavInputs[].

 Configuration flags stored in io.ConfigFlags. Set by user/application.
 Master keyboard navigation enable flag. NewFrame() will automatically fill io.NavInputs[] based on io.KeysDown[].
 Master gamepad navigation enable flag. This is mostly to instruct your imgui backend to fill io.NavInputs[]. Backend also needs to set ImGuiBackendFlags_HasGamepad.
 Instruct navigation to move the mouse cursor. May be useful on TV/console systems where moving a virtual mouse is awkward. Will update io.MousePos and set io.WantSetMousePos=true. If enabled you MUST honor io.WantSetMousePos requests in your backend, otherwise ImGui will react as if the mouse is jumping around back and forth.
 Instruct navigation to not set the io.WantCaptureKeyboard flag when io.NavActive is set.
 Instruct imgui to clear mouse position/buttons in NewFrame(). This allows ignoring the mouse information set by the backend.
 Instruct backend to not alter mouse cursor shape and visibility. Use if the backend cursor changes are interfering with yours and you don't want to use SetMouseCursor() to change mouse cursor. You may want to honor requests from imgui by reading GetMouseCursor() yourself instead.
 User storage (to allow your backend/engine to communicate to code that may be shared between multiple projects. Those flags are not used by core Dear ImGui)
 Application is SRGB-aware.
 Application is using a touch screen instead of a mouse.
 Backend capabilities flags stored in io.BackendFlags. Set by imgui_impl_xxx or custom backend.
 Backend Platform supports gamepad and currently has one connected.
 Backend Platform supports honoring GetMouseCursor() value to change the OS cursor shape.
 Backend Platform supports io.WantSetMousePos requests to reposition the OS mouse position (only used if ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableSetMousePos is set).
 Backend Renderer supports ImDrawCmd::VtxOffset. This enables output of large meshes (64K+ vertices) while still using 16-bit indices.

 Enumeration for PushStyleVar() / PopStyleVar() to temporarily modify the ImGuiStyle structure.
 - The enum only refers to fields of ImGuiStyle which makes sense to be pushed/popped inside UI code.
   During initialization or between frames, feel free to just poke into ImGuiStyle directly.
 - Tip: Use your programming IDE navigation facilities on the names in the _second column_ below to find the actual members and their description.
   In Visual Studio IDE: CTRL+comma ("Edit.NavigateTo") can follow symbols in comments, whereas CTRL+F12 ("Edit.GoToImplementation") cannot.
   With Visual Assist installed: ALT+G ("VAssistX.GoToImplementation") can also follow symbols in comments.
 - When changing this enum, you need to update the associated internal table GStyleVarInfo[] accordingly. This is where we link enum values to members offset/type.

 [Internal] Masks
 Obsolete names (will be removed)
 [renamed in 1.69]
 Flags for DragFloat(), DragInt(), SliderFloat(), SliderInt() etc.
 We use the same sets of flags for DragXXX() and SliderXXX() functions as the features are the same and it makes it easier to swap them.
 Clamp value to min/max bounds when input manually with CTRL+Click. By default CTRL+Click allows going out of bounds.
 Make the widget logarithmic (linear otherwise). Consider using ImGuiSliderFlags_NoRoundToFormat with this if using a format-string with small amount of digits.
 Disable rounding underlying value to match precision of the display format string (e.g. %.3f values are rounded to those 3 digits)
 Disable CTRL+Click or Enter key allowing to input text directly into the widget
 [Internal] We treat using those bits as being potentially a 'float power' argument from the previous API that has got miscast to this enum, and will trigger an assert if needed.
 Obsolete names (will be removed)
 [renamed in 1.79]
 Identify a mouse button.
 Those values are guaranteed to be stable and we frequently use 0/1 directly. Named enums provided for convenience.
 Enumeration for GetMouseCursor()
 User code may request backend to display given cursor by calling SetMouseCursor(), which is why we have some cursors that are marked unused here
 When hovering over InputText, etc.
 (Unused by Dear ImGui functions)
 When hovering over an horizontal border
 When hovering over a vertical border or a column
 When hovering over the bottom-left corner of a window
 When hovering over the bottom-right corner of a window
 (Unused by Dear ImGui functions. Use for e.g. hyperlinks)
 When hovering something with disallowed interaction. Usually a crossed circle.
 Enumeration for ImGui::SetWindow***(), SetNextWindow***(), SetNextItem***() functions
 Represent a condition.
 Important: Treat as a regular enum! Do NOT combine multiple values using binary operators! All the functions above treat 0 as a shortcut to ImGuiCond_Always.
 No condition (always set the variable), same as _Always
 No condition (always set the variable)
 Set the variable once per runtime session (only the first call will succeed)
 Set the variable if the object/window has no persistently saved data (no entry in .ini file)
 Set the variable if the object/window is appearing after being hidden/inactive (or the first time)

 [SECTION] Helpers: Memory allocations macros, ImVector<>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 IM_MALLOC(), IM_FREE(), IM_NEW(), IM_PLACEMENT_NEW(), IM_DELETE()
 We call C++ constructor on own allocated memory via the placement "new(ptr) Type()" syntax.
 Defining a custom placement new() with a custom parameter allows us to bypass including <new> which on some platforms complains when user has disabled exceptions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is only required so we can use the symmetrical new()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ImVector<>
 Lightweight std::vector<>-like class to avoid dragging dependencies (also, some implementations of STL with debug enabled are absurdly slow, we bypass it so our code runs fast in debug).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - You generally do NOT need to care or use this ever. But we need to make it available in imgui.h because some of our public structures are relying on it.
 - We use std-like naming convention here, which is a little unusual for this codebase.
 - Important: clear() frees memory, resize(0) keep the allocated buffer. We use resize(0) a lot to intentionally recycle allocated buffers across frames and amortize our costs.
 - Important: our implementation does NOT call C++ constructors/destructors, we treat everything as raw data! This is intentional but be extra mindful of that,
   Do NOT use this class as a std::vector replacement in your own code! Many of the structures used by dear imgui can be safely initialized by a zero-memset.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Provide standard typedefs but we don't use them ourselves.
 Constructors, destructor
 Important: does not destruct anything
 Important: does not destruct anything
 Important: never called automatically! always explicit.
 Important: never called automatically! always explicit.
 Resize a vector to a smaller size, guaranteed not to cause a reallocation
 NB: It is illegal to call push_back/push_front/insert with a reference pointing inside the ImVector data itself! e.g. v.push_back(v[10]) is forbidden.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [SECTION] ImGuiStyle
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You may modify the ImGui::GetStyle() main instance during initialization and before NewFrame().
 During the frame, use ImGui::PushStyleVar(ImGuiStyleVar_XXXX)/PopStyleVar() to alter the main style values,
 and ImGui::PushStyleColor(ImGuiCol_XXX)/PopStyleColor() for colors.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Global alpha applies to everything in Dear ImGui.
 Additional alpha multiplier applied by BeginDisabled(). Multiply over current value of Alpha.
 Padding within a window.
 Radius of window corners rounding. Set to 0.0f to have rectangular windows. Large values tend to lead to variety of artifacts and are not recommended.
 Thickness of border around windows. Generally set to 0.0f or 1.0f. (Other values are not well tested and more CPU/GPU costly).
 Minimum window size. This is a global setting. If you want to constraint individual windows, use SetNextWindowSizeConstraints().
 Alignment for title bar text. Defaults to (0.0f,0.5f) for left-aligned,vertically centered.
 Side of the collapsing/docking button in the title bar (None/Left/Right). Defaults to ImGuiDir_Left.
 Radius of child window corners rounding. Set to 0.0f to have rectangular windows.
 Thickness of border around child windows. Generally set to 0.0f or 1.0f. (Other values are not well tested and more CPU/GPU costly).
 Radius of popup window corners rounding. (Note that tooltip windows use WindowRounding)
 Thickness of border around popup/tooltip windows. Generally set to 0.0f or 1.0f. (Other values are not well tested and more CPU/GPU costly).
 Padding within a framed rectangle (used by most widgets).
 Radius of frame corners rounding. Set to 0.0f to have rectangular frame (used by most widgets).
 Thickness of border around frames. Generally set to 0.0f or 1.0f. (Other values are not well tested and more CPU/GPU costly).
 Horizontal and vertical spacing between widgets/lines.
 Horizontal and vertical spacing between within elements of a composed widget (e.g. a slider and its label).
 Padding within a table cell
 Expand reactive bounding box for touch-based system where touch position is not accurate enough. Unfortunately we don't sort widgets so priority on overlap will always be given to the first widget. So don't grow this too much!
 Horizontal indentation when e.g. entering a tree node. Generally == (FontSize + FramePadding.x*2).
 Minimum horizontal spacing between two columns. Preferably > (FramePadding.x + 1).
 Width of the vertical scrollbar, Height of the horizontal scrollbar.
 Radius of grab corners for scrollbar.
 Minimum width/height of a grab box for slider/scrollbar.
 Radius of grabs corners rounding. Set to 0.0f to have rectangular slider grabs.
 The size in pixels of the dead-zone around zero on logarithmic sliders that cross zero.
 Radius of upper corners of a tab. Set to 0.0f to have rectangular tabs.
 Thickness of border around tabs.
 Minimum width for close button to appears on an unselected tab when hovered. Set to 0.0f to always show when hovering, set to FLT_MAX to never show close button unless selected.
 Side of the color button in the ColorEdit4 widget (left/right). Defaults to ImGuiDir_Right.
 Alignment of button text when button is larger than text. Defaults to (0.5f, 0.5f) (centered).
 Alignment of selectable text. Defaults to (0.0f, 0.0f) (top-left aligned). It's generally important to keep this left-aligned if you want to lay multiple items on a same line.
 Window position are clamped to be visible within the display area or monitors by at least this amount. Only applies to regular windows.
 If you cannot see the edges of your screen (e.g. on a TV) increase the safe area padding. Apply to popups/tooltips as well regular windows. NB: Prefer configuring your TV sets correctly!
 Scale software rendered mouse cursor (when io.MouseDrawCursor is enabled). May be removed later.
 Enable anti-aliased lines/borders. Disable if you are really tight on CPU/GPU. Latched at the beginning of the frame (copied to ImDrawList).
 Enable anti-aliased lines/borders using textures where possible. Require backend to render with bilinear filtering. Latched at the beginning of the frame (copied to ImDrawList).
 Enable anti-aliased edges around filled shapes (rounded rectangles, circles, etc.). Disable if you are really tight on CPU/GPU. Latched at the beginning of the frame (copied to ImDrawList).
 Tessellation tolerance when using PathBezierCurveTo() without a specific number of segments. Decrease for highly tessellated curves (higher quality, more polygons), increase to reduce quality.
 Maximum error (in pixels) allowed when using AddCircle()/AddCircleFilled() or drawing rounded corner rectangles with no explicit segment count specified. Decrease for higher quality but more geometry.

 Time elapsed since last frame, in seconds.
 Minimum time between saving positions/sizes to .ini file, in seconds.
 Path to .ini file (important: default "imgui.ini" is relative to current working dir!). Set NULL to disable automatic .ini loading/saving or if you want to manually call LoadIniSettingsXXX() / SaveIniSettingsXXX() functions.
 Path to .log file (default parameter to ImGui::LogToFile when no file is specified).

 Global scale all fonts
 Allow user scaling text of individual window with CTRL+Wheel.
 Font to use on NewFrame(). Use NULL to uses Fonts->Fonts[0].
 For retina display or other situations where window coordinates are different from framebuffer coordinates. This generally ends up in ImDrawData::FramebufferScale.
 Miscellaneous options
 Request ImGui to draw a mouse cursor for you (if you are on a platform without a mouse cursor). Cannot be easily renamed to 'io.ConfigXXX' because this is frequently used by backend implementations.
 OS X style: Text editing cursor movement using Alt instead of Ctrl, Shortcuts using Cmd/Super instead of Ctrl, Line/Text Start and End using Cmd+Arrows instead of Home/End, Double click selects by word instead of selecting whole text, Multi-selection in lists uses Cmd/Super instead of Ctrl.
 Enable blinking cursor (optional as some users consider it to be distracting).
 [BETA] Enable turning DragXXX widgets into text input with a simple mouse click-release (without moving). Not desirable on devices without a keyboard.
 Enable resizing of windows from their edges and from the lower-left corner. This requires (io.BackendFlags & ImGuiBackendFlags_HasMouseCursors) because it needs mouse cursor feedback. (This used to be a per-window ImGuiWindowFlags_ResizeFromAnySide flag)
 Enable allowing to move windows only when clicking on their title bar. Does not apply to windows without a title bar.
 Timer (in seconds) to free transient windows/tables memory buffers when unused. Set to -1.0f to disable.
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Platform Functions

 Optional: Access OS clipboard
 (default to use native Win32 clipboard on Windows, otherwise uses a private clipboard. Override to access OS clipboard on other architectures)
 Optional: Notify OS Input Method Editor of the screen position of your cursor for text input position (e.g. when using Japanese/Chinese IME on Windows)
 (default to use native imm32 api on Windows)
 (Windows) Set this to your HWND to get automatic IME cursor positioning.
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Input - Fill before calling NewFrame()

 Mouse position, in pixels. Set to ImVec2(-FLT_MAX, -FLT_MAX) if mouse is unavailable (on another screen, etc.)
 Mouse buttons: 0=left, 1=right, 2=middle + extras (ImGuiMouseButton_COUNT == 5). Dear ImGui mostly uses left and right buttons. Others buttons allows us to track if the mouse is being used by your application + available to user as a convenience via IsMouse** API.
 Mouse wheel Vertical: 1 unit scrolls about 5 lines text.
 Mouse wheel Horizontal. Most users don't have a mouse with an horizontal wheel, may not be filled by all backends.
 Keyboard modifier pressed: Control
 Keyboard modifier pressed: Shift
 Keyboard modifier pressed: Alt
 Keyboard modifier pressed: Cmd/Super/Windows
 Keyboard keys that are pressed (ideally left in the "native" order your engine has access to keyboard keys, so you can use your own defines/enums for keys).

 Output - Updated by NewFrame() or EndFrame()/Render()
 (when reading from the io.WantCaptureMouse, io.WantCaptureKeyboard flags to dispatch your inputs, it is
  generally easier and more correct to use their state BEFORE calling NewFrame(). See FAQ for details!)
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Set when Dear ImGui will use mouse inputs, in this case do not dispatch them to your main game/application (either way, always pass on mouse inputs to imgui). (e.g. unclicked mouse is hovering over an imgui window, widget is active, mouse was clicked over an imgui window, etc.).
 Set when Dear ImGui will use keyboard inputs, in this case do not dispatch them to your main game/application (either way, always pass keyboard inputs to imgui). (e.g. InputText active, or an imgui window is focused and navigation is enabled, etc.).
 Mobile/console: when set, you may display an on-screen keyboard. This is set by Dear ImGui when it wants textual keyboard input to happen (e.g. when a InputText widget is active).
 MousePos has been altered, backend should reposition mouse on next frame. Rarely used! Set only when ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableSetMousePos flag is enabled.
 When manual .ini load/save is active (io.IniFilename == NULL), this will be set to notify your application that you can call SaveIniSettingsToMemory() and save yourself. Important: clear io.WantSaveIniSettings yourself after saving!
 Keyboard/Gamepad navigation is currently allowed (will handle ImGuiKey_NavXXX events) = a window is focused and it doesn't use the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs flag.
 Keyboard/Gamepad navigation is visible and allowed (will handle ImGuiKey_NavXXX events).

 [SECTION] Misc data structures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Shared state of InputText(), passed as an argument to your callback when a ImGuiInputTextFlags_Callback* flag is used.
 The callback function should return 0 by default.
 Callbacks (follow a flag name and see comments in ImGuiInputTextFlags_ declarations for more details)
 - ImGuiInputTextFlags_CallbackEdit:        Callback on buffer edit (note that InputText() already returns true on edit, the callback is useful mainly to manipulate the underlying buffer while focus is active)
 - ImGuiInputTextFlags_CallbackAlways:      Callback on each iteration
 - ImGuiInputTextFlags_CallbackCompletion:  Callback on pressing TAB
 - ImGuiInputTextFlags_CallbackHistory:     Callback on pressing Up/Down arrows
 - ImGuiInputTextFlags_CallbackCharFilter:  Callback on character inputs to replace or discard them. Modify 'EventChar' to replace or discard, or return 1 in callback to discard.
 - ImGuiInputTextFlags_CallbackResize:      Callback on buffer capacity changes request (beyond 'buf_size' parameter value), allowing the string to grow.
 Read-only
 Read-only
 Read-only
 Arguments for the different callback events
 - To modify the text buffer in a callback, prefer using the InsertChars() / DeleteChars() function. InsertChars() will take care of calling the resize callback if necessary.
 - If you know your edits are not going to resize the underlying buffer allocation, you may modify the contents of 'Buf[]' directly. You need to update 'BufTextLen' accordingly (0 <= BufTextLen < BufSize) and set 'BufDirty'' to true so InputText can update its internal state.
 [CharFilter] Replace character with another one, or set to zero to drop. return 1 is equivalent to setting EventChar=0;
 [Completion,History]
 [Resize] Can replace pointer / [Completion,History,Always] Only write to pointed data, don't replace the actual pointer!
 [Resize,Completion,History,Always] Exclude zero-terminator storage. In C land: == strlen(some_text), in C++ land: string.length()
 [Resize,Completion,History,Always] Include zero-terminator storage. In C land == ARRAYSIZE(my_char_array), in C++ land: string.capacity()+1
 [Completion,History,Always]
 [Completion,History,Always]
 [Completion,History,Always] == to SelectionEnd when no selection)
 [Completion,History,Always]
 Helper functions for text manipulation.
 Use those function to benefit from the CallbackResize behaviors. Calling those function reset the selection.
 Resizing callback data to apply custom constraint. As enabled by SetNextWindowSizeConstraints(). Callback is called during the next Begin().
 NB: For basic min/max size constraint on each axis you don't need to use the callback! The SetNextWindowSizeConstraints() parameters are enough.
 Read-only.   What user passed to SetNextWindowSizeConstraints()
 Read-only.   Window position, for reference.
 Read-only.   Current window size.
 Read-write.  Desired size, based on user's mouse position. Write to this field to restrain resizing.
 Data payload for Drag and Drop operations: AcceptDragDropPayload(), GetDragDropPayload()
 Members
 Data (copied and owned by dear imgui)
 Data size
 [Internal]
 Source item id
 Source parent id (if available)
 Data timestamp
 Data type tag (short user-supplied string, 32 characters max)
 Set when AcceptDragDropPayload() was called and mouse has been hovering the target item (nb: handle overlapping drag targets)
 Set when AcceptDragDropPayload() was called and mouse button is released over the target item.
 Sorting specification for one column of a table (sizeof == 12 bytes)
 User id of the column (if specified by a TableSetupColumn() call)
 Index of the column
 Index within parent ImGuiTableSortSpecs (always stored in order starting from 0, tables sorted on a single criteria will always have a 0 here)
 ImGuiSortDirection_Ascending or ImGuiSortDirection_Descending (you can use this or SortSign, whichever is more convenient for your sort function)
 Sorting specifications for a table (often handling sort specs for a single column, occasionally more)
 Obtained by calling TableGetSortSpecs().
 When 'SpecsDirty == true' you can sort your data. It will be true with sorting specs have changed since last call, or the first time.
 Make sure to set 'SpecsDirty = false' after sorting, else you may wastefully sort your data every frame!
 Pointer to sort spec array.
 Sort spec count. Most often 1. May be > 1 when ImGuiTableFlags_SortMulti is enabled. May be == 0 when ImGuiTableFlags_SortTristate is enabled.
 Set to true when specs have changed since last time! Use this to sort again, then clear the flag.

 [SECTION] Helpers (ImGuiOnceUponAFrame, ImGuiTextFilter, ImGuiTextBuffer, ImGuiStorage, ImGuiListClipper, ImColor)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Helper: Unicode defines
 Invalid Unicode code point (standard value).
 Maximum Unicode code point supported by this build.
 Maximum Unicode code point supported by this build.
 Helper: Execute a block of code at maximum once a frame. Convenient if you want to quickly create an UI within deep-nested code that runs multiple times every frame.
 Usage: static ImGuiOnceUponAFrame oaf; if (oaf) ImGui::Text("This will be called only once per frame");
 Helper: Parse and apply text filters. In format "aaaaa[,bbbb][,ccccc]"
 Helper calling InputText+Build
 [Internal]
 Helper: Growable text buffer for logging/accumulating text
 (this could be called 'ImGuiTextBuilder' / 'ImGuiStringBuilder')
 Buf is zero-terminated, so end() will point on the zero-terminator
 Helper: Key->Value storage
 Typically you don't have to worry about this since a storage is held within each Window.
 We use it to e.g. store collapse state for a tree (Int 0/1)
 This is optimized for efficient lookup (dichotomy into a contiguous buffer) and rare insertion (typically tied to user interactions aka max once a frame)
 You can use it as custom user storage for temporary values. Declare your own storage if, for example:
 - You want to manipulate the open/close state of a particular sub-tree in your interface (tree node uses Int 0/1 to store their state).
 - You want to store custom debug data easily without adding or editing structures in your code (probably not efficient, but convenient)
 Types are NOT stored, so it is up to you to make sure your Key don't collide with different types.
 [Internal]
 - Get***() functions find pair, never add/allocate. Pairs are sorted so a query is O(log N)
 - Set***() functions find pair, insertion on demand if missing.
 - Sorted insertion is costly, paid once. A typical frame shouldn't need to insert any new pair.
 default_val is NULL
 - Get***Ref() functions finds pair, insert on demand if missing, return pointer. Useful if you intend to do Get+Set.
 - References are only valid until a new value is added to the storage. Calling a Set***() function or a Get***Ref() function invalidates the pointer.
 - A typical use case where this is convenient for quick hacking (e.g. add storage during a live Edit&Continue session if you can't modify existing struct)
      float* pvar = ImGui::GetFloatRef(key); ImGui::SliderFloat("var", pvar, 0, 100.0f); some_var += *pvar;
 Use on your own storage if you know only integer are being stored (open/close all tree nodes)
 For quicker full rebuild of a storage (instead of an incremental one), you may add all your contents and then sort once.
 Helper: Manually clip large list of items.
 If you are submitting lots of evenly spaced items and you have a random access to the list, you can perform coarse
 clipping based on visibility to save yourself from processing those items at all.
 The clipper calculates the range of visible items and advance the cursor to compensate for the non-visible items we have skipped.
 (Dear ImGui already clip items based on their bounds but it needs to measure text size to do so, whereas manual coarse clipping before submission makes this cost and your own data fetching/submission cost almost null)
 Usage:
   ImGuiListClipper clipper;
 We have 1000 elements, evenly spaced.
   while (clipper.Step())
       for (int i = clipper.DisplayStart; i < clipper.DisplayEnd; i++)
           ImGui::Text("line number %d", i);
 Generally what happens is:
 - Clipper lets you process the first element (DisplayStart = 0, DisplayEnd = 1) regardless of it being visible or not.
 - User code submit one element.
 - Clipper can measure the height of the first element
 - Clipper calculate the actual range of elements to display based on the current clipping rectangle, position the cursor before the first visible element.
 - User code submit visible elements.
 [Internal]
 items_count: Use INT_MAX if you don't know how many items you have (in which case the cursor won't be advanced in the final step)
 items_height: Use -1.0f to be calculated automatically on first step. Otherwise pass in the distance between your items, typically GetTextLineHeightWithSpacing() or GetFrameHeightWithSpacing().
 Automatically called by constructor if you passed 'items_count' or by Step() in Step 1.
 Automatically called on the last call of Step() that returns false.
 Call until it returns false. The DisplayStart/DisplayEnd fields will be set and you can process/draw those items.
 [removed in 1.79]
 Helpers macros to generate 32-bit encoded colors
 Opaque white = 0xFFFFFFFF
 Opaque black
 Transparent black = 0x00000000
 Helper: ImColor() implicitly converts colors to either ImU32 (packed 4x1 byte) or ImVec4 (4x1 float)
 Prefer using IM_COL32() macros if you want a guaranteed compile-time ImU32 for usage with ImDrawList API.
 **Avoid storing ImColor! Store either u32 of ImVec4. This is not a full-featured color class. MAY OBSOLETE.
 **None of the ImGui API are using ImColor directly but you can use it as a convenience to pass colors in either ImU32 or ImVec4 formats. Explicitly cast to ImU32 or ImVec4 if needed.
 FIXME-OBSOLETE: May need to obsolete/cleanup those helpers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [SECTION] Drawing API (ImDrawCmd, ImDrawIdx, ImDrawVert, ImDrawChannel, ImDrawListSplitter, ImDrawListFlags, ImDrawList, ImDrawData)
 Hold a series of drawing commands. The user provides a renderer for ImDrawData which essentially contains an array of ImDrawList.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The maximum line width to bake anti-aliased textures for. Build atlas with ImFontAtlasFlags_NoBakedLines to disable baking.
 ImDrawCallback: Draw callbacks for advanced uses [configurable type: override in imconfig.h]
 NB: You most likely do NOT need to use draw callbacks just to create your own widget or customized UI rendering,
 you can poke into the draw list for that! Draw callback may be useful for example to:
  A) Change your GPU render state,
  B) render a complex 3D scene inside a UI element without an intermediate texture/render target, etc.
 The expected behavior from your rendering function is 'if (cmd.UserCallback != NULL) { cmd.UserCallback(parent_list, cmd); } else { RenderTriangles() }'
 If you want to override the signature of ImDrawCallback, you can simply use e.g. '#define ImDrawCallback MyDrawCallback' (in imconfig.h) + update rendering backend accordingly.
 Special Draw callback value to request renderer backend to reset the graphics/render state.
 The renderer backend needs to handle this special value, otherwise it will crash trying to call a function at this address.
 This is useful for example if you submitted callbacks which you know have altered the render state and you want it to be restored.
 It is not done by default because they are many perfectly useful way of altering render state for imgui contents (e.g. changing shader/blending settings before an Image call).
 Typically, 1 command = 1 GPU draw call (unless command is a callback)
 - VtxOffset/IdxOffset: When 'io.BackendFlags & ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset' is enabled,
   those fields allow us to render meshes larger than 64K vertices while keeping 16-bit indices.
   Pre-1.71 backends will typically ignore the VtxOffset/IdxOffset fields.
 - The ClipRect/TextureId/VtxOffset fields must be contiguous as we memcmp() them together (this is asserted for).
 Clipping rectangle (x1, y1, x2, y2). Subtract ImDrawData->DisplayPos to get clipping rectangle in "viewport" coordinates
 User-provided texture ID. Set by user in ImfontAtlas::SetTexID() for fonts or passed to Image*() functions. Ignore if never using images or multiple fonts atlas.
 Start offset in vertex buffer. ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset: always 0, otherwise may be >0 to support meshes larger than 64K vertices with 16-bit indices.
 Start offset in index buffer. Always equal to sum of ElemCount drawn so far.
 Number of indices (multiple of 3) to be rendered as triangles. Vertices are stored in the callee ImDrawList's vtx_buffer[] array, indices in idx_buffer[].
 If != NULL, call the function instead of rendering the vertices. clip_rect and texture_id will be set normally.
 The draw callback code can access this.
 Also ensure our padding fields are zeroed
 Since 1.83: returns ImTextureID associated with this draw call. Warning: DO NOT assume this is always same as 'TextureId' (we will change this function for an upcoming feature)
 Vertex layout
 You can override the vertex format layout by defining IMGUI_OVERRIDE_DRAWVERT_STRUCT_LAYOUT in imconfig.h
 The code expect ImVec2 pos (8 bytes), ImVec2 uv (8 bytes), ImU32 col (4 bytes), but you can re-order them or add other fields as needed to simplify integration in your engine.
 The type has to be described within the macro (you can either declare the struct or use a typedef). This is because ImVec2/ImU32 are likely not declared a the time you'd want to set your type up.
 NOTE: IMGUI DOESN'T CLEAR THE STRUCTURE AND DOESN'T CALL A CONSTRUCTOR SO ANY CUSTOM FIELD WILL BE UNINITIALIZED. IF YOU ADD EXTRA FIELDS (SUCH AS A 'Z' COORDINATES) YOU WILL NEED TO CLEAR THEM DURING RENDER OR TO IGNORE THEM.
 [Internal] For use by ImDrawList
 [Internal] For use by ImDrawListSplitter
 Split/Merge functions are used to split the draw list into different layers which can be drawn into out of order.
 This is used by the Columns/Tables API, so items of each column can be batched together in a same draw call.
 Current channel number (0)
 Number of active channels (1+)
 Draw channels (not resized down so _Count might be < Channels.Size)
 Do not clear Channels[] so our allocations are reused next frame
 Flags for ImDrawList functions
 (Legacy: bit 0 must always correspond to ImDrawFlags_Closed to be backward compatible with old API using a bool. Bits 1..3 must be unused)
 PathStroke(), AddPolyline(): specify that shape should be closed (Important: this is always == 1 for legacy reason)
 AddRect(), AddRectFilled(), PathRect(): enable rounding top-left corner only (when rounding > 0.0f, we default to all corners). Was 0x01.
 AddRect(), AddRectFilled(), PathRect(): enable rounding top-right corner only (when rounding > 0.0f, we default to all corners). Was 0x02.
 AddRect(), AddRectFilled(), PathRect(): enable rounding bottom-left corner only (when rounding > 0.0f, we default to all corners). Was 0x04.
 AddRect(), AddRectFilled(), PathRect(): enable rounding bottom-right corner only (when rounding > 0.0f, we default to all corners). Wax 0x08.
 AddRect(), AddRectFilled(), PathRect(): disable rounding on all corners (when rounding > 0.0f). This is NOT zero, NOT an implicit flag!
 Default to ALL corners if none of the _RoundCornersXX flags are specified.
 Flags for ImDrawList instance. Those are set automatically by ImGui:: functions from ImGuiIO settings, and generally not manipulated directly.
 It is however possible to temporarily alter flags between calls to ImDrawList:: functions.
 Enable anti-aliased lines/borders (*2 the number of triangles for 1.0f wide line or lines thin enough to be drawn using textures, otherwise *3 the number of triangles)
 Enable anti-aliased lines/borders using textures when possible. Require backend to render with bilinear filtering.
 Enable anti-aliased edge around filled shapes (rounded rectangles, circles).
 Can emit 'VtxOffset > 0' to allow large meshes. Set when 'ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset' is enabled.
 Draw command list
 This is the low-level list of polygons that ImGui:: functions are filling. At the end of the frame,
 all command lists are passed to your ImGuiIO::RenderDrawListFn function for rendering.
 Each dear imgui window contains its own ImDrawList. You can use ImGui::GetWindowDrawList() to
 access the current window draw list and draw custom primitives.
 You can interleave normal ImGui:: calls and adding primitives to the current draw list.
 In single viewport mode, top-left is == GetMainViewport()->Pos (generally 0,0), bottom-right is == GetMainViewport()->Pos+Size (generally io.DisplaySize).
 You are totally free to apply whatever transformation matrix to want to the data (depending on the use of the transformation you may want to apply it to ClipRect as well!)
 Important: Primitives are always added to the list and not culled (culling is done at higher-level by ImGui:: functions), if you use this API a lot consider coarse culling your drawn objects.
 This is what you have to render
 Draw commands. Typically 1 command = 1 GPU draw call, unless the command is a callback.
 Index buffer. Each command consume ImDrawCmd::ElemCount of those
 Vertex buffer.
 Flags, you may poke into these to adjust anti-aliasing settings per-primitive.

 If you want to create ImDrawList instances, pass them ImGui::GetDrawListSharedData() or create and use your own ImDrawListSharedData (so you can use ImDrawList without ImGui)
 Render-level scissoring. This is passed down to your render function but not used for CPU-side coarse clipping. Prefer using higher-level ImGui::PushClipRect() to affect logic (hit-testing and widget culling)
 Primitives
 - For rectangular primitives, "p_min" and "p_max" represent the upper-left and lower-right corners.
 - For circle primitives, use "num_segments == 0" to automatically calculate tessellation (preferred).
   In older versions (until Dear ImGui 1.77) the AddCircle functions defaulted to num_segments == 12.
   In future versions we will use textures to provide cheaper and higher-quality circles.
   Use AddNgon() and AddNgonFilled() functions if you need to guaranteed a specific number of sides.
 a: upper-left, b: lower-right (== upper-left + size)
 a: upper-left, b: lower-right (== upper-left + size)
 Note: Anti-aliased filling requires points to be in clockwise order.
 Cubic Bezier (4 control points)
 Quadratic Bezier (3 control points)
 Image primitives
 - Read FAQ to understand what ImTextureID is.
 - "p_min" and "p_max" represent the upper-left and lower-right corners of the rectangle.
 - "uv_min" and "uv_max" represent the normalized texture coordinates to use for those corners. Using (0,0)->(1,1) texture coordinates will generally display the entire texture.
 Stateful path API, add points then finish with PathFillConvex() or PathStroke()
 Note: Anti-aliased filling requires points to be in clockwise order.
 Use precomputed angles for a 12 steps circle
 Cubic Bezier (4 control points)
 Quadratic Bezier (3 control points)
 Advanced
 Your rendering function must check for 'UserCallback' in ImDrawCmd and call the function instead of rendering triangles.
 This is useful if you need to forcefully create a new draw call (to allow for dependent rendering / blending). Otherwise primitives are merged into the same draw-call as much as possible
 Create a clone of the CmdBuffer/IdxBuffer/VtxBuffer.
 Advanced: Channels
 - Use to split render into layers. By switching channels to can render out-of-order (e.g. submit FG primitives before BG primitives)
 - Use to minimize draw calls (e.g. if going back-and-forth between multiple clipping rectangles, prefer to append into separate channels then merge at the end)
 - FIXME-OBSOLETE: This API shouldn't have been in ImDrawList in the first place!
   Prefer using your own persistent instance of ImDrawListSplitter as you can stack them.
   Using the ImDrawList::ChannelsXXXX you cannot stack a split over another.
 Advanced: Primitives allocations
 - We render triangles (three vertices)
 - All primitives needs to be reserved via PrimReserve() beforehand.
 Axis aligned rectangle (composed of two triangles)
 Write vertex with unique index

 Helper to convert all buffers from indexed to non-indexed, in case you cannot render indexed. Note: this is slow and most likely a waste of resources. Always prefer indexed rendering!
 Helper to scale the ClipRect field of each ImDrawCmd. Use if your final output buffer is at a different scale than Dear ImGui expects, or if there is a difference between your window resolution and framebuffer resolution.

github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/tests/oversample/README.md for details.
 Rasterize at higher quality for sub-pixel positioning. This is not really useful as we don't use sub-pixel positions on the Y axis.
 Align every glyph to pixel boundary. Useful e.g. if you are merging a non-pixel aligned font with the default font. If enabled, you can set OversampleH/V to 1.
 Extra spacing (in pixels) between glyphs. Only X axis is supported for now.
 Offset all glyphs from this font input.
 Pointer to a user-provided list of Unicode range (2 value per range, values are inclusive, zero-terminated list). THE ARRAY DATA NEEDS TO PERSIST AS LONG AS THE FONT IS ALIVE.
 Minimum AdvanceX for glyphs, set Min to align font icons, set both Min/Max to enforce mono-space font
 Maximum AdvanceX for glyphs
 Merge into previous ImFont, so you can combine multiple inputs font into one ImFont (e.g. ASCII font + icons + Japanese glyphs). You may want to use GlyphOffset.y when merge font of different heights.
 Settings for custom font builder. THIS IS BUILDER IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENT. Leave as zero if unsure.
 Brighten (>1.0f) or darken (<1.0f) font output. Brightening small fonts may be a good workaround to make them more readable.
 Explicitly specify unicode codepoint of ellipsis character. When fonts are being merged first specified ellipsis will be used.

 Name (strictly to ease debugging)
 Hold rendering data for one glyph.
 (Note: some language parsers may fail to convert the 31+1 bitfield members, in this case maybe drop store a single u32 or we can rework this)
 Flag to indicate glyph is colored and should generally ignore tinting (make it usable with no shift on little-endian as this is used in loops)
 Flag to indicate glyph has no visible pixels (e.g. space). Allow early out when rendering.
 0x0000..0x10FFFF
 Distance to next character (= data from font + ImFontConfig::GlyphExtraSpacing.x baked in)
 Glyph corners
 Texture coordinates
 Helper to build glyph ranges from text/string data. Feed your application strings/characters to it then call BuildRanges().
 This is essentially a tightly packed of vector of 64k booleans = 8KB storage.
 Store 1-bit per Unicode code point (0=unused, 1=used)
 Get bit n in the array
 Set bit n in the array
 Add character
 Add string (each character of the UTF-8 string are added)
 Add ranges, e.g. builder.AddRanges(ImFontAtlas::GetGlyphRangesDefault()) to force add all of ASCII/Latin+Ext
 Output new ranges
 See ImFontAtlas::AddCustomRectXXX functions.
 Desired rectangle dimension
 Packed position in Atlas
 For custom font glyphs only (ID < 0x110000)
 For custom font glyphs only: glyph xadvance
 For custom font glyphs only: glyph display offset
 For custom font glyphs only: target font
 Flags for ImFontAtlas build
 Don't round the height to next power of two
 Don't build software mouse cursors into the atlas (save a little texture memory)
 Don't build thick line textures into the atlas (save a little texture memory). The AntiAliasedLinesUseTex features uses them, otherwise they will be rendered using polygons (more expensive for CPU/GPU).
 Load and rasterize multiple TTF/OTF fonts into a same texture. The font atlas will build a single texture holding:
  - One or more fonts.
  - Custom graphics data needed to render the shapes needed by Dear ImGui.
  - Mouse cursor shapes for software cursor rendering (unless setting 'Flags |= ImFontAtlasFlags_NoMouseCursors' in the font atlas).
 It is the user-code responsibility to setup/build the atlas, then upload the pixel data into a texture accessible by your graphics api.
  - Optionally, call any of the AddFont*** functions. If you don't call any, the default font embedded in the code will be loaded for you.
  - Call GetTexDataAsAlpha8() or GetTexDataAsRGBA32() to build and retrieve pixels data.
  - Upload the pixels data into a texture within your graphics system (see imgui_impl_xxxx.cpp examples)
  - Call SetTexID(my_tex_id); and pass the pointer/identifier to your texture in a format natural to your graphics API.
    This value will be passed back to you during rendering to identify the texture. Read FAQ entry about ImTextureID for more details.
 Common pitfalls:
 - If you pass a 'glyph_ranges' array to AddFont*** functions, you need to make sure that your array persist up until the
   atlas is build (when calling GetTexData*** or Build()). We only copy the pointer, not the data.
 - Important: By default, AddFontFromMemoryTTF() takes ownership of the data. Even though we are not writing to it, we will free the pointer on destruction.
   You can set font_cfg->FontDataOwnedByAtlas=false to keep ownership of your data and it won't be freed,
 - Even though many functions are suffixed with "TTF", OTF data is supported just as well.
 - This is an old API and it is currently awkward for those and and various other reasons! We will address them in the future!
 Note: Transfer ownership of 'ttf_data' to ImFontAtlas! Will be deleted after destruction of the atlas. Set font_cfg->FontDataOwnedByAtlas=false to keep ownership of your data and it won't be freed.
 'compressed_font_data' still owned by caller. Compress with binary_to_compressed_c.cpp.
 'compressed_font_data_base85' still owned by caller. Compress with binary_to_compressed_c.cpp with -base85 parameter.
 Clear input data (all ImFontConfig structures including sizes, TTF data, glyph ranges, etc.) = all the data used to build the texture and fonts.
 Clear output texture data (CPU side). Saves RAM once the texture has been copied to graphics memory.
 Clear output font data (glyphs storage, UV coordinates).
 Clear all input and output.
 Build atlas, retrieve pixel data.
 User is in charge of copying the pixels into graphics memory (e.g. create a texture with your engine). Then store your texture handle with SetTexID().
 The pitch is always = Width * BytesPerPixels (1 or 4)
 Building in RGBA32 format is provided for convenience and compatibility, but note that unless you manually manipulate or copy color data into
 the texture (e.g. when using the AddCustomRect*** api), then the RGB pixels emitted will always be white (~75% of memory/bandwidth waste.
 Build pixels data. This is called automatically for you by the GetTexData*** functions.
 1 byte per-pixel
 4 bytes-per-pixel
 Bit ambiguous: used to detect when user didn't built texture but effectively we should check TexID != 0 except that would be backend dependent...
-------------------------------------------
 Glyph Ranges
-------------------------------------------
 Helpers to retrieve list of common Unicode ranges (2 value per range, values are inclusive, zero-terminated list)
 NB: Make sure that your string are UTF-8 and NOT in your local code page. In C++11, you can create UTF-8 string literal using the u8"Hello world" syntax. See FAQ for details.
 NB: Consider using ImFontGlyphRangesBuilder to build glyph ranges from textual data.
 Basic Latin, Extended Latin
 Default + Korean characters
 Default + Hiragana, Katakana, Half-Width, Selection of 2999 Ideographs
 Default + Half-Width + Japanese Hiragana/Katakana + full set of about 21000 CJK Unified Ideographs
 Default + Half-Width + Japanese Hiragana/Katakana + set of 2500 CJK Unified Ideographs for common simplified Chinese
 Default + about 400 Cyrillic characters
 Default + Thai characters
 Default + Vietnamese characters
-------------------------------------------
 [BETA] Custom Rectangles/Glyphs API
-------------------------------------------
 You can request arbitrary rectangles to be packed into the atlas, for your own purposes.
 - After calling Build(), you can query the rectangle position and render your pixels.
 - If you render colored output, set 'atlas->TexPixelsUseColors = true' as this may help some backends decide of prefered texture format.
 - You can also request your rectangles to be mapped as font glyph (given a font + Unicode point),
   so you can render e.g. custom colorful icons and use them as regular glyphs.
 - Read docs/FONTS.md for more details about using colorful icons.
 - Note: this API may be redesigned later in order to support multi-monitor varying DPI settings.

 Members
-------------------------------------------
 Build flags (see ImFontAtlasFlags_)
 User data to refer to the texture once it has been uploaded to user's graphic systems. It is passed back to you during rendering via the ImDrawCmd structure.
 Texture width desired by user before Build(). Must be a power-of-two. If have many glyphs your graphics API have texture size restrictions you may want to increase texture width to decrease height.
 Padding between glyphs within texture in pixels. Defaults to 1. If your rendering method doesn't rely on bilinear filtering you may set this to 0.
 Marked as Locked by ImGui::NewFrame() so attempt to modify the atlas will assert.
 [Internal]
 NB: Access texture data via GetTexData*() calls! Which will setup a default font for you.
 Set when texture was built matching current font input
 Tell whether our texture data is known to use colors (rather than just alpha channel), in order to help backend select a format.
 1 component per pixel, each component is unsigned 8-bit. Total size = TexWidth * TexHeight
 4 component per pixel, each component is unsigned 8-bit. Total size = TexWidth * TexHeight * 4
 Texture width calculated during Build().
 Texture height calculated during Build().
 = (1.0f/TexWidth, 1.0f/TexHeight)
 Texture coordinates to a white pixel
 Hold all the fonts returned by AddFont*. Fonts[0] is the default font upon calling ImGui::NewFrame(), use ImGui::PushFont()/PopFont() to change the current font.
 Rectangles for packing custom texture data into the atlas.
 Configuration data
 UVs for baked anti-aliased lines
 [Internal] Font builder
 Opaque interface to a font builder (default to stb_truetype, can be changed to use FreeType by defining IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE).
 Shared flags (for all fonts) for custom font builder. THIS IS BUILD IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENT. Per-font override is also available in ImFontConfig.
 [Internal] Packing data
 Custom texture rectangle ID for white pixel and mouse cursors
 Custom texture rectangle ID for baked anti-aliased lines

 Font runtime data and rendering
 ImFontAtlas automatically loads a default embedded font for you when you call GetTexDataAsAlpha8() or GetTexDataAsRGBA32().
 Members: Hot ~20/24 bytes (for CalcTextSize)
 Sparse. Glyphs->AdvanceX in a directly indexable way (cache-friendly for CalcTextSize functions which only this this info, and are often bottleneck in large UI).
 = FallbackGlyph->AdvanceX
 Height of characters/line, set during loading (don't change after loading)
 Members: Hot ~28/40 bytes (for CalcTextSize + render loop)
 Sparse. Index glyphs by Unicode code-point.
 All glyphs.
 = FindGlyph(FontFallbackChar)
 Members: Cold ~32/40 bytes
 What we has been loaded into
 Pointer within ContainerAtlas->ConfigData
 Number of ImFontConfig involved in creating this font. Bigger than 1 when merging multiple font sources into one ImFont.
 Character used if a glyph isn't found.
 Character used for ellipsis rendering.
 Character used for ellipsis rendering (if a single '...' character isn't found)

 Base font scale, multiplied by the per-window font scale which you can adjust with SetWindowFontScale()
 Ascent: distance from top to bottom of e.g. 'A' [0..FontSize]
 Total surface in pixels to get an idea of the font rasterization/texture cost (not exact, we approximate the cost of padding between glyphs)
 2 bytes if ImWchar=ImWchar16, 34 bytes if ImWchar==ImWchar32. Store 1-bit for each block of 4K codepoints that has one active glyph. This is mainly used to facilitate iterations across all used codepoints.
 Methods
 'max_width' stops rendering after a certain width (could be turned into a 2d size). FLT_MAX to disable.
 'wrap_width' enable automatic word-wrapping across multiple lines to fit into given width. 0.0f to disable.
 utf8
 [Internal] Don't use!
 Makes 'dst' character/glyph points to 'src' character/glyph. Currently needs to be called AFTER fonts have been built.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [SECTION] Viewports
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Flags stored in ImGuiViewport::Flags, giving indications to the platform backends.
 Represent a Platform Window
 Represent a Platform Monitor (unused yet)
 Platform Window: is created/managed by the application (rather than a dear imgui backend)
 - Currently represents the Platform Window created by the application which is hosting our Dear ImGui windows.
 - In 'docking' branch with multi-viewport enabled, we extend this concept to have multiple active viewports.
 - In the future we will extend this concept further to also represent Platform Monitor and support a "no main platform window" operation mode.
 - About Main Area vs Work Area:
   - Main Area = entire viewport.
   - Work Area = entire viewport minus sections used by main menu bars (for platform windows), or by task bar (for platform monitor).
   - Windows are generally trying to stay within the Work Area of their host viewport.
 See ImGuiViewportFlags_
 Main Area: Position of the viewport (Dear ImGui coordinates are the same as OS desktop/native coordinates)
 Main Area: Size of the viewport.
 Work Area: Position of the viewport minus task bars, menus bars, status bars (>= Pos)
 Work Area: Size of the viewport minus task bars, menu bars, status bars (<= Size)
